<h2>THE OLD FURNITURE BOOK.</h2>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br /><span class="small">OLD OAK, OLD LEATHER, TURKEY WORK, ETC.</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the revival of interest in all "antiques,"
which is so widely spread at this time, any of us who
chance to own an old piece of furniture feel an added
degree of affection for it if we can give it an approximate
date and assign it to a maker or a country.
There is much good old furniture in the United States,
chiefly of Spanish, Dutch and English make, though
there are constant importations of other makes, notably
French, since it is recognized on all sides that
Americans are becoming the collectors of the world.
Our public museums are gradually filling with works
of art presented by broad-minded citizens, while the
private galleries are rich and increasing every day.
To keep pace with these possessions, furniture from
old palaces and manor-houses is being hauled forth
and set up again in our New World homes. Indeed,
whole interiors have been removed from ancient dwellings,
and the superb carvings of other days become
the ornaments of modern houses, like the gilded oak
panels from the Hotel Montmorency which were built
into the Deacon House in Boston, or like Mrs. Gardiner's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Venetian carved wood which decorates her palace
in the Boston Fens.</p>

<p>Oak panelling, like everything else, passed through
various periods and styles. In Queen Elizabeth's
time the panels were carried to within about two feet
of the cornice; then, after some years, there came a
division into lower and upper panelling, the upper
beginning at about the height of the back of a chair
from the floor. Pictures became more common, and
they were frequently let into the upper panelling, and
then it was discarded altogether, only the lower half
or dado being retained. This, too, after some years,
became old-fashioned, and the board known as skirting,
or base-board, was all that was left of the handsome
sheathing which extended from the floor almost
to the ceiling. This old oak panelling was entirely
without polish or varnish of any kind, and grew with
years and dust almost black in colour. Sometimes it
was inlaid with other woods, and often it was made
for the rooms where it was placed. Where the panels
are carved, they are generally bought in that state and
set in plain framework by the household joiner. If,
however, the frame is carved and the panels plain,
they were made to suit the taste and purse of the
owner of the mansion. Oak panelling took the place
of the arras, tapestry hangings, and crude woodwork
of earlier times. Of course it was adopted by the rich
and luxurious, for it rendered more air-tight the
draughty buildings.</p>

<p>The oldest furniture was made of oak, more or less
carved, whether of Spanish, Italian, Dutch, or English
make. The multiplication of objects which we
consider necessary as "furnishings" were pleasingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
absent, and chests used as receptacles for clothes or
linens, for seats by day and beds by night, with a few
beds also of carved oak, and tables, made up the chief
articles of domestic use.</p>

<p>Even the very word "furniture" itself is of obscure
origin and was used formerly, as now, to describe the
fittings of houses, churches, and other buildings.</p>

<p>There are a few terms applied to furniture referring
either to its decoration or process of manufacture
with which it is well to become acquainted. They
are given here in the order of their importance.</p>

<p><i>Veneering</i> is the process of coating common wood
with slices of rare and costly woods fastened down
with glue by screw presses made to fit the surface to
be covered. It was first used in the reign of William
and Mary, in the last decade of the seventeenth century.
Until that time furniture had been made of solid
wood. Veneer of this early period, particularly burr-walnut
veneer, was about one sixteenth of an inch
thick, and was sometimes applied to oak. Chippendale,
Hepplewhite, and Sheraton used mahogany and
satin-wood both solid and for veneers. When used as
veneers they were all hand-cut, as they are in all high-class
furniture to-day. It was not till the late Georgian
period that machinery for cutting veneer was
first used, and slices were produced one thirty-second
of an inch in thickness. Most of the cheaper kinds of
modern furniture are veneered.</p>

<p><i>Marquetry</i> is veneer of different woods, forming a
mosaic of ornamental designs. In the early days of
the art, figure subjects, architectural designs, and
interiors were often represented in this manner.</p>

<p><i>Rococo</i>, made up from two French words meaning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
rock and shells, <i>roequaille et coquaille</i>, is a florid style
of ornamentation which was in vogue in the latter
part of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p><i>Buhl</i>, or <i>Boulle</i>, is inlaid work with tortoise-shell or
metals in arabesques or cartouches. It derived its
name from Boule, a French wood-carver who brought
it to its highest perfection.</p>

<p><i>Ormolu</i> refers to designs in brass mounted upon the
surface of the wood. This metal was given an
exceedingly brilliant colour by the use of less zinc and
more copper than is commonly used in the composition
of brass, and was sometimes still further made
bright by the use of varnish and lacquer.</p>

<p><i>Baroque.</i> This word, which was derived from the
Portuguese <i>baroco</i>, meant originally a large irregular
pearl. At first the term was used only by jewellers,
but it gradually became technically applied to
describe a kind of ornament which became popular on
furniture early in the nineteenth century, after the
rage for the classic had passed. It consisted of a
wealth of ornament lavished in an unmeaning manner
merely for display; and scrolls, curves, and designs
from leaves were used to cover pieces, making them
lack beauty and that grace which comes from pure and
simple lines.</p>

<p><i>Lacquer</i> is coloured or opaque varnish applied to
metallic objects as well as wood. The name is
obtained from "resin lac," the material which is used
as the base of all lacquers. In the East Indies the
whole surface of wooden objects, large and small, is
covered with bright-coloured lacquers. The Japanese
lacquers are the finest that are made. They excel in
the variety and exquisite perfection of this style of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
work, and under their skilful manipulation it
becomes one of the choicest forms of decorative art.
The most highly prized lacquer is on a gold ground,
some specimens of which reached Europe in the time
of Louis XV.</p>

<p><i>Japanning.</i> This style of treating wood and metal
derives its name from the fact of its being an imitation
of the famous lacquering of Japan, although the
latter is prepared with entirely different materials and
processes, and is in every way much more durable,
brilliant, and beautiful than any European "Japan
work." This latter process is done in clear transparent
varnishes, or in black or colours, but the black
japan is the most common. By japanning a very
brilliant polished surface may be secured, which is
more durable than ordinary painted or varnished
work. It is usually applied to small articles of wood,
to clock-faces, papier-maché, etc.</p>

<p><i>Joined</i> furniture. All the parts are joined by mortise
and tenon, no nails or glue being used. This
method prevents the parts from warping or springing,
as so much of the modern machine-made furniture
does.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_2">Figure 1</a> shows an ancient carved-oak bed of the
time of Queen Elizabeth, with grotesque carvings on
the headboard in Renaissance style, which is said to
have been introduced into England by Holbein. This
bed has an interesting history. It belongs to the
Herricks of Beaumanor Park, and came to them from
Professor Babington, of St. John's College, Cambridge,
England. He inherited it from his father, whose ancestors
kept the "Blue Boar" inn at Leicester, where
Richard III slept the night before the battle of Bosworth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Field, in August, 1485. This has always been
called "King Richard's Bed," and many learned antiquaries
have waxed eloquent for and against this
assumption. Mr. Henry Shaw, author of "Specimens
of Early Furniture," published in 1836, says it is a
good specimen of the modern four-poster of Elizabeth's
time, the more ancient beds being without foot-posts.
In fact the earlier beds were mere couches.
As more luxury was demanded they grew larger,
counterpanes were made of the richest materials, gorgeously
embroidered with the arms and badges of
their owners, and from their great cost and imperishable
character descended from one generation to another.
They provided employment, too, for the lady
of the castle and her bower maidens, who had no end
of leisure which had to be filled in some way, and
which dragged along for many a long year, broken
only by the chance visit of a wandering hawker or my
lord's return from the wars.</p>

<p>Hollingbourne Manor, in Kent, is one of the old
mansions still standing which was built in Queen
Elizabeth's time. The manor was originally owned
by Sir Thomas Culpeper, and his initials appear in
many places about the house. In the great hall the
fireplace has an iron back with the initials "T. C." and
the date 1683 wrought in it. The present owner, Mr.
Gerald Arbuthnot, has preserved the old-time atmosphere
as much as possible, and in connection with
home-made tapestry the "needle-room" is especially
interesting. In that room the four Ladies Culpeper,
daughters of that John, Lord Culpeper, who was
exiled for his devotion to King Charles, spent so
much of their time making tapestry that one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
sisters became blind from the effects of her close
application. Among the pieces of the handiwork of
the four sisters preserved is a magnificent altar-cloth
which they presented to the parish church. For two
centuries and a half a needle left by the fingers of the
worker remained sticking in the corner of the cloth,
but it was stolen about two years ago by some one of
a party of antiquarians visiting the Manor.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 2. OLIVE-WOOD CHEST.</p>
</div>

<p>In Mr. Shaw's book already quoted are many items
concerning these great and handsome beds, which
were often the finest pieces of furniture in the castle
or manor, and from the safe seclusion of which the
king or great lord received the homage of his vassals.</p>

<p>The bed and bedstead were sometimes classed
separately, but in many inventories the former word
covers the bedstead and all its furnishings. The
fittings of the bed were well in keeping with the fine
carved woodwork, and were of softest feathers or
down. Sheets of linen, and rugs or blankets of fine
wool, were covered by a cloth woven of samite,
damask, or heavy with gold threads.</p>

<p>Richard, Earl of Arundel, in 1392, left to Philippa,
his second wife,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"a blue bed marked with my arms and the arms of my late
wife, also the hangings of the hall, which were lately made in
London, of blue tapestry with red roses, with the arms of my sons,
the Earl Marshall, Lord Charlton, and Mons. Willm. Beauchamp;
to my son Richard, a standing bed called "Clove"; also a bed of
silk embroidered with the arms of Arundel and Warren quarterly;
to my dear son Thomas, my blue bed of silk embroidered with
greffins; to my daughter Margaret my blue bed."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not many earls had so great a store of worldly goods.</p>

<p>In 1434 Joanne, Lady Bergavenny, devises&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"a bed of gold swans, with tapettar of green tapestry, with
bunches and flowers of diverse colours; and two pair of sheets of
Raynes; a pair of fustian, six pairs of other sheets; six pairs of
blankets; six mattrasses; six pillows; and with cushions and
bancoves that longen with the bed aforesaid."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was only one bed of six specified by this lady,
several being of velvet, silk, and one of "bande kyn,"
a rich and splendid stuff of gold thread and silk, still
farther enriched with embroidery. Before the cloth
spread or counterpane the covering was of fur. It was
also the fashion in these primitive times to name the
beds, like that specified "Clove" in the Earl of
Arundel's inventory, sometimes with the names of
flowers, sometimes with those of the planets or of
birds. The beds were surmounted with testers or
canopies of rich silk edged with fringes, and suspended
from the rafters of the room by silk cords. There
were side-curtains also, and much carving on the headboard,
while the foot-posts, as we have said, are wanting
in the earliest beds, prior to the year 1500. Mr.
Shaw goes on to say that there are very few beds still
extant which date before Elizabethan times, and that
the most ancient he met with was of the time of Henry
VIII., and belonged to a clergyman of Blackheath who
bought it out of an old manor-house. The posts and
back are elaborately carved in Gothic style, but the
cornice is missing.</p>

<p>Of Elizabethan times there are several noted beds
extant, the finest of them being known as the "Great
Bed of Ware" mentioned by Shakespeare in "Twelfth
Night." It is seven feet high and ten feet square.
There is one in the South Kensington Museum,
London, more richly carved than the one we show,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
and having in addition a carved foot-board. This bed
is dated 1593.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Figure 3. OLD OAK CHEST.</p>
</div>

<p>The curtains and hangings which have in our day
become mere ornaments were during the Elizabethan
period most necessary. Windows unglazed, and rude
walls unplastered, or at best hung with tapestry,
permitted drafts to wander through the sleeping-rooms,
so that the curtains were closely drawn at night for
actual protection. At best in many a castle or dwelling
of the wealthy but one bed would be found, and
that belonged to the lord and lady, the rest of the
family taking their rest on rugs or cushions bestowed
on the floor, or on chests or settees, or even on
tables.</p>

<p>There are also found, though rarely, oak tables of
this period, or perhaps a little later, heavily carved
along the sides, and with ponderous turned legs and
plain stout braces. These tables, perhaps the earliest
approach to a sideboard, are so long that they have
six legs, the top seldom being less than twelve feet
in length. One we refer to was found recently in an
old barn in England, where it had lain since the
neighbouring manor-house had been pulled down in
1760. While its condition was good,&mdash;that is, needing
no restoring,&mdash;it had become nearly black and almost
fossilized from exposure. It is now used as a sideboard
by the vicar of the parish who found it in its
lowly estate, and on it stand pewter and plate, also
antiques from the neighbourhood. Such treasures
can seldom be found here, certainly not any that have
lain concealed since 1760.</p>

<p>After the Elizabethan period the next one of importance
may be called Jacobean. James I. encouraged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
his people to use chairs instead of stools. It was not
long before settles, lounges, and "scrowled chairs," the
latter inlaid with coloured woods, crowded out the
stools of former days, and the idea of enriching the
useful became the interest of the skilled workman,
and utility was no longer the measure of value.
Stools, to be sure, were still used, but they had heavy
cushions of brocade, or worked stuff, or velvet, and were
hung around with a rich fringe and with gimp, fastened
with fancy nails. The arm-chairs of this period,
a fashion introduced from Venice, had the legs in a
curved X shape across the front, and chairs are still
extant which were used by James I. himself. These
chairs, which are all somewhat similar in design, were
rendered still more comfortable by a loose cushion
which could be adapted to the inclination of the
sitter. The bedsteads of the period were also smothered
in draperies, the tester trimmed with rows upon
rows of fringe, the head-boards, carved and gilded,
being about the only woodwork allowed to show.</p>

<p>As we have said, the earliest wood used, at least in
northern England, seems to have been oak. At the
close of the sixteenth century there was furniture
decorated with inlays of different coloured woods,
marbles, agate, or lapis lazuli. Ivory carved and
inlaid, carved and gilded wood, metals and tortoise-shell,
were used also in making the sumptuous furniture
of the Renaissance. The greatest elegance of
form and detail was observed during this century, and
it declined noticeably all over Europe, during the
seventeenth century. The framework became heavy
and bulky and the details coarse. Silver furniture
made in Spain and Italy was used in the courts of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
French and English kings. Then came the carved
and gilded furniture which received its greatest perfection
in Italy, though it was made throughout
Europe till late in the eighteenth century.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Figure 4. CHEST WITH ONE DRAWER.</p>
</div>

<p>Second only to the bed in importance as an item of
household furnishing was the chest, a seat by day, a
bed by night, and a storehouse of valuables always.
It usually stood at the foot of the bed, possibly so
that it could not be pilfered at night without the
owner's knowledge. Some chests, heavily made, provided
with locks and bound with iron, held all the
worldly wealth of the owner, as well as his papers and
deeds. Before the time of James I. bills of exchange
were not used, and the actual coin passed in all transactions.
Italy was the first country to establish banks,
the money-dealers of Florence practising banking as
early as the thirteenth century. Holland followed
their example, and in 1609 the Bank of Amsterdam
was founded, but kept in its coffers the actual coin
paid in, being merely a repository for safe keeping.
England had no bank until the seventeenth century,
when this business was undertaken by the goldsmiths
of London. The Bank of England was not founded
until 1694. It can be easily seen how necessary a
part of the household goods a stout chest for valuables
was, especially in remote parts of the country, where
access to the cities was not easy. Not alone in houses
was the chest a necessary article; one or more were a
part of every church's furniture, and in them were
kept the vestments, church linen, the plate, and other
valuables.</p>

<p>There is a lawsuit mentioned in the Court Records
of New Amsterdam, where one of two sisters living at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Jericho, Long Island, about 1647, sues a neighbour
for coming into their house and breaking into her
chest, which was in her bedroom, and stealing from it
several measures of wheat which were stored therein,
as well as some coins which were in the till.</p>

<p>The wearing-apparel of the family also was kept in
these chests, and for years before her marriage the
daughter of the house was employed in filling one up
with linen spun and woven through all the different
processes from the flax, the size and fullness of the
chest often proving quite a factor in the marriage
negotiations.</p>

<p>The chests of the Jacobean time, enriched with
mouldings, panellings, and drop ornaments, are by no
means unknown in America. They are furnished
with drawers, cupboards, and then drawers above,
making them massive and useful pieces of furniture.
They stand upon large round legs, and the handles to
drawers and cupboards are drops. In Italy marriage
chests were beautifully painted, often by famous masters,
and sometimes gilded as well. In Holland the
chests were carved or inlaid; and many of these,
owing to the commercial relations between England
and Holland, found their way into the former country
and thence to America, in addition to those brought
directly from the Low Countries. Chests were used
as trunks by travelers long before Shakespeare's time,
and he makes a chest play an important part in
"Cymbeline." In the early days of the American
colonies, when the settlers sent back to England for
comforts not procurable in America, these were generally
despatched in chests for safe keeping and to
preserve their contents. The following letter shows a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
lady's desire to get hold of her property which had
been unduly detained. Lady Moody was a member
in 1643 of the Colony of Massachusetts, but, "being
taken with the error of denying baptism to infants,
was dealt with by many of the elders," As she persisted
in her "error" she was persuaded by friends, in
order to avoid further trouble, to move to the New
Netherlands. This she did, and it is noted by the
Rev. Thomas Cobbett, of Lynn, that "Lady Moody
is to sitt down on Long Island, from under civil and
church watch, among the Dutch."</p>

<p>Later she became a warm friend of the younger
Winthrop, and many letters passed between them.
The following was written in 1649:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Wurthi Sur:</p>

<p>My respective love to you, remembering and acknowledging
your many kindnesses and respect to me. I have written
divers lines to you, but I doubt you have not received it. At
present being in haste I can not unlay myselfe, but my request is
y<sup>t</sup> you will be pleased by this note, if in your wisdom you see not a
convenienter opertunity to send me those things y<sup>t</sup> Mr Throgmorton
bought for me, and I understand are with you, for I am in
great need of y<sup>e</sup>, together with Mark Lucas's chest and other
things.</p>

<p>"So, with my respective love to you and your wife and Mrs
Locke remembered, hoping you and they with your children are in
helth, I rest; committing you to y<sup>e</sup> protection of y<sup>e</sup> Almighty.
Pray remember my necessity in this thing.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Deborah Moody.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chests are to be found in the well-settled as well as
in out-of-the-way corners, and of Dutch, English, and
American make. The Dutch, broadly speaking, are
more common in the neighbourhood of New York,
Albany, and other places settled by these pioneers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
from Holland, while the English-made ones, many of
them, are to be found in New England, and scattered
over the Eastern States as well, since in the past year
I have seen two fine ones, both found in the western
part of New York State. The very earliest chests
which were among the effects of our first settlers are
very plain affairs, hardly more than boxes mounted
on simple sawed legs. They were all furnished with
locks, and generally with rude handles, and we can
well conceive the motley array of household and personal
"stuff" which came over in them. Elder
Brewster's chest is in the Memorial Hall at Plymouth,
and is just such a plain box on legs as has been described.</p>

<p>Though there were many oak chests undoubtedly
brought over during these early years, there were also
many of pine, and, being plain and cheap receptacles,
more easily damaged than if of harder wood,
they gave way to better and more ornate pieces as
soon as the family fortunes warranted it.</p>

<p>In Flanders were made many fronts of chests only,
quite elaborately carved, and sent to England, there to
be fitted with the other parts. Among the guilds the
chest-makers bore an important part, as chests, particularly
of churches, were sometimes fastened with
two locks, and the lock plates were often very highly
and handsomely wrought. Of later years chests of
every degree of elegance and beauty have found their
way to America; some covered with carving of the
florid style of the Renaissance, some still showing
traces of the fine gilding with which they were covered.
Even some of historic interest are owned here, such as
the carved chest of olive-wood said to have belonged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
to the Stuarts, and brought to this country by a
member of the family who fled to Virginia after the
beheading of Charles I. It remained in the possession
of a family named Stuart till recently, and was bought
by its present owner, Miss C. F. Marsh, of Clermont-on-the-James.
This chest, though restored as to its
feet, is remarkable on account of the decorations on
the inside of its lid, which are unusual in that place,
and from the fact that they are done in burnt work
as well as carving. A portrait of James I. occupies
the centre, and there are carved panels on either side
depicting the "Judgment of Solomon." On the top
of the lid the arms of the Stuarts are burnt in, while
the front is decorated with panels of castles and warriors,
and above the middle panel are the British lions
supporting the royal arms. This chest is about six
feet in length, twenty-four inches high, and twenty-two
inches wide. The plantation on which it was
found belonged to Captain John Smith in 1610. Its
real value was quite unknown to those who possessed
it. It was sold at auction, and was bought by a German
farmer for a feed-box, on account of its strength.
He carted it home, and was so satisfied with his bargain
that he was quite unwilling to sell. It is made of
eight-inch planks of olive-wood, cut several centuries
ago in Palestine.</p>

<p>Nor is this the only chest of this description in the
country. In Memorial Hall, Philadelphia, is one very
similar to it <a href="#Page_7">(Figure 2)</a>, but in a perfect state of preservation,
with the original ball feet and more ornate
twisted wrought-iron handles. The style of decoration
on the two chests is quite similar, they are both made
of olive-wood, but the wrought-iron handles are much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
handsomer on the Philadelphia chest than on the
Stuart one. It has, however, no carving on the inside
of the lid; the four panels of carving are enclosed with
a moulding; but the lions rampant are very well done,
and there are figures in cavalier costume on the panels.
While, of course, elegant chests like these are most
uncommon, it is the less ornate specimens which
prove the most interesting, because there is more likelihood
of our becoming possessed of them.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_9">Figure 3</a> represents a good specimen of one of these
early chests. It is of English make, entirely of oak,
the boards of the bottom being as heavy and solid as
lead. The top is a heavy plank of oak with a fine
grain. The chest is panelled within and has one till.
The lock is modern, and some nails have been driven
to hold the chest together, for the back legs as well as
the sides are worm-eaten. This chest is three feet
nine inches long, twenty-eight inches high, and twenty
inches wide, and is in good condition save for the
nails. Its date is about the last quarter of the seventeenth
century. It was found in New York State and
belongs to Mr. W. M. Hoyt of Rochester. While oak
and pine were the most common materials for these
chests, olive-wood was sometimes used, as we have
seen, and sometimes the panels were of cedar, and the
ornaments of some of the softer woods, like pine or
maple, coloured and stained to imitate ebony. American
walnut came into use late in the seventeenth
century, but, although used in furniture and popular
as a veneer, it was not used for chests. Cypress wood
was also in demand as a material for chests, the aromatic
smell keeping off the pest of housekeepers, the
moth. In summer time the heavy woollen tapestries and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
woollen clothes of the family were stowed away, and
the former, at least, from their cost and the labour
expended upon them, had to be carefully protected.</p>

<p>The roughest sort of a chest was called a "standard,"
and in it were packed the more perishable movables
and furniture; and in moving from one residence
to another these standards were carried by pack-horses
or on rude carts. Chinese chests of teak-wood,
lacquer, or cedar are very rarely met with, though you
will sometimes see them in old homes in England,
where some ancestor of the family followed the sea.</p>

<p>The inventory of the estate of Colonel Francis Epes,
of Henrico County, Virginia, dated October 1, 1678,
is a long and varied one. The first article recorded is
"One foure foot chest of drawers seder Sprinkled new,
but damnified £1-10.0." Further along are mentioned&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"one middle size calve skin truncke with drawers. One old
leather truncke with lock and key ... one old middle size chest
with lock and key. One small old chest with lock and key. Two
other old chests without keys and one without hinges."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quite a number of chests and trunks for one family
when it is noted that they had chests of drawers also.
When the Rev. Samuel Sewall, so well-known from
his voluminous diary, returned from a trip to England
in 1689, he brought with him on the ship "America"
a trunk for each of his three children, with their names
and the dates of their births carved thereon. Presumably
these trunks did not come over empty. He
brought also a sea-chest, a barrel of books, a large
trunk marked H. S. with nails, two smaller trunks, a
deal box of linen, a small case of liquors, and a great
case of bottles. He slept on a feather bed laid above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
a straw bed on the voyage, and was comfortably covered
with a bedquilt.</p>

<p>American oak was used, however, in many American-made
chests. Some of the early chests, particularly
those found in the United States, stand flat on
the ground. Others have legs, sometimes formed by
the continuation of the stiles, as those parts of the
chests are called which hold the panels on the sides.
The two boards which occupy the top and bottom
of the sides and back and front are called the rails.
The upper rails in some of the chests of early make
have a row of carving on them which adds still further
to the beauty of the chest, and in some instances the
stiles are also carved. Ordinarily, however, the stiles
are plain or with but a slight moulding, and the rails are
quite plain. Geometric patterns in arched, diamond,
or square form were early employed, each maker copying
industriously the patterns used by other makers
and only occasionally having the originality to design
for himself. After the legs formed by the continuation
of the stiles came legs made in the shape of great
balls such as were used on much Dutch furniture and
were copied by the English makers.</p>

<p>The great Dutch <i>kas</i>, or chest, was a very large and
ornamental piece of furniture, carved, painted, or
decorated in marquetry. Such pieces are unusual
now, most of them having been gathered in by collectors
or museums, the Dutch towns along the Hudson,
as well as Albany and Schenectady, having been pretty
well picked over.</p>

<p>The evolution of the bureau from the chest is an
interesting study, and shows plainly the different
periods through which the useful and homely "kist"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
passed before it emerged into such an ornamental
thing as the carved and decorated highboy. The first
step in its upward career was taken when a drawer
was added below the chest proper. This came as early
as the last half of the seventeenth century, those
chests belonging to the first half being without
drawers. Sometimes this single drawer was divided,
and the very earliest specimens had the runners on
which the drawers moved on the sides, and not on the
bottom, as came later. The sides of the drawer were
hollowed out in a groove, and a stout runner was
affixed to the side of the chest. Such a chest is shown
in <a href="#Page_11">Figure 4</a>. With the appearance of drawers came a
difference in ornamentation, and mouldings in great
variety were used, beading and turned drops also
coming in for use. These patterns were merely the
familiar mouldings used in wainscots and panellings
put to the purpose of adorning the chests. The early
chests without drawers ran in the neighbourhood of
five feet long and twenty-four inches high. As the
drawers were added, the chests naturally rose in
height, and to prevent their becoming too bulky they
decreased in length.</p>

<p>A nice example of one of these early oak chests,
mounted on turned legs and with curved strainers, is
shown in <a href="#Page_13">Figure 5</a>. It is in a fine state of preservation
and has the original brass escutcheons. It was
evidently intended as a receptacle for valuables, as
both drawer and chest are made to lock. It belongs
to the Waring Galleries, London. Two drawers
followed one, the chest portion still retaining its
prominence, and in this simple way the chest of
drawers grew from the box-like affair of 1600 and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
later. By 1710 chests were looked upon as "old,"
and so advertised for sale, although they continued to
be made until the middle of the eighteenth century.
They were too useful to be abandoned by a people who
were obliged to be often on the move, and who
needed some stout receptacle in which to carry their
household and personal goods.</p>

<p>There are chests which are peculiar to certain localities,
notably in New England, which were doubtless
made by a single cabinet-maker, his workmen and
apprentices. They are almost entirely confined to
these localities, and are therefore of less interest to
the collector in general than such pieces as are more
widely distributed. Under this head comes that style
of receptacle known as the Hadley Chest, and the
Connecticut chest shown in Chapter V. The Dutch
chests were often of pine, painted, only the choicest
ones being of walnut. One inventory records a "chest
brought from Havanna,"&mdash;probably Spanish.</p>

<p>After matters became a little less anxious for the
early settlers, personal comfort began to be thought
of more, and such colonists as had brought no chairs
began to send for them to England or have them
made in America. Every ship from England took
out fresh comforts, and the dignitaries of the colonies
had substantial household gear. Tables, chairs, beds,
and carpets,&mdash;these latter not for floors, but for use as
table-covers,&mdash;are mentioned with great frequency in
the inventories, and the settlers' house, albeit many of
them boasted of but four rooms, had more than a
modest degree of luxury.</p>

<p>The New Haven Colony&mdash;as indeed did all the
Colonies&mdash;had, as her chief officers, men used to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
best that England afforded, and the following inventory
speaks for itself. John Haynes, governor of
Connecticut, in 1653 left an estate at Hartford valued
at £1,400. In his hall, one of the most esteemed
parts of the house at this period, were,&mdash;</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>
<table summary="list">

</table>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>&mdash;the whole valued at £8 13<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> The parlor had
velvet chairs and stools, also Turkey-wrought chairs,
and a green cloth carpet valued at £1 10<i>s.</i> There
were also curtains of say, curtain rods and "vallants,"
many napkins, as these were necessary from lack of
forks, and much Holland bed and table linen. There
were many chests and "lean-to" or livery cupboards.</p>

<p>"The men's chamber," had "a bedstead with two
flock beds; one feather boulster, one flock do.; one
blanket; one coverlet." His best rooms had feather
beds. In the cellar were many brewing-vessels and
wooden-ware, while the kitchen had a complete
"garnish" of pewter, but not a single piece of crockery.
Brass candlesticks, iron possnets and porringers, and
the useful brass warming-pan were here also. Theophilus
Eaton, also governor of Connecticut, left in
1657 an inventory of goods of even greater value.</p>

<p>Even earlier than this, rich furniture was imported
by those who could afford it, and in 1645 a Mistress
Lake, sister-in-law of Governor Winthrop the younger,
sent to England for the furnishings for her daughter's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
new house. There were many items in the list, and
among them were only one&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"bedsteede of carven oak; 2 armed cheares with fine rushe
bottums; three large &amp; three small silvern spoons, &amp; 6 of
horne."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As late as 1755 "armed cheares" were highly
esteemed, and Joseph Allison, of Albany, N. Y.,
bequeathed two to his second son, a walking-cane to
his firstborn, and to his youngest son some clothes.
Chairs, stools, and cushions are mentioned in many
inventories as being covered with "set work;" this
was heavy woolen tapestry much after the fashion of
Oriental rugs, and most durable. It is rather unusual
to find no mention of leather chairs in inventories, for
they were used in America late in 1600, and chairs
covered with "redd lether," as well as with Spanish
leather, are of frequent occurrence.</p>

<p>Lion Gardiner was one of the chief proprietors of
Easthampton, L. I., in 1653, where he passed the last
ten years of his life "rummaging old papers" and in
other peaceful pursuits. The inventory of his estate
is set out fully and seems scant enough.</p>

<p>It was this same Lion Gardiner who, after the
Pequot War, bought from the Indians the island
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Monchonock, embracing thirty-five acres of hill and dale.
The price paid was a large black dog, a gun, some
powder and shot, a few Dutch blankets. This is the
place which we know to-day as Gardiner's Island.
The "great cheirs" mentioned in the inventory were,
no doubt, either Turkey-work or leather, and seem to
be the only articles of this kind of furniture possessed
by him.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>In 1638, in London, a man named Christopher took
out a patent for decorating leather, which somewhat
reduced its cost. Up to this time all leather was
imported from Spain or Holland.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_17">Figure 6</a> is a fine example of a Portuguese or Spanish
leather chair, as they were variously called, and
shows well the splendid and ornamental leather as well
as the rich carving seen particularly on the front brace.
The leather is fastened to the frame with large brass
nails, and that part of the oak frame which is exposed
is turned work. On many of these chairs there are
three little metal ornaments on the curved top. In
this example two are lost. Besides the carving on
the front brace, a pattern which was often adopted
and copied by English and Dutch cabinet-makers,
this chair shows well that form of foot which came to
be known as the "Spanish foot." It is seen on all
makes of furniture, and with some variations of form,
but always turns out at the base, and has the grooved
work so conspicuous in <a href="#Page_17">Figure 6</a>. There is no doubt
that this was an exceedingly popular style of chair,
for there are many examples almost exactly like this
in many collections. This particular one is in the
Boston Museum of Fine Arts.</p>

<p>Another style of leather chair is shown in <a href="#Page_20">Figure 7</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
and its solidity is a great contrast to the Spanish chair
previously shown. The woodwork is turned, and the
heavy underbracing shaped, while the second bracing
is a feature peculiar to this chair itself. The date of
this piece is probably about 1650, or a little later,&mdash;about
the same date as similar turned pieces which are
covered with Turkey work. The leather on the seat
is so old and worn that it seems as if it had never been
renewed, while the back is much fresher and looks
comparatively new. The seat of this chair is so high
from the floor that a footstool was a necessity, and in
the old inventories the item of "low stools," or "foot-banks"
appears with some frequency. This chair is of
about the same period as the Spanish leather chairs.
Many leather chairs are found in the United States,
both North and South, and are probably of English
make. Some inventories mention them as "old," as
early as 1667, and many were in use in different parts
of the country.</p>

<p>But while most of our early New England colonists
were grappling with the serious business of life, almost
content if they could scrape together enough to eat
and to wear, and a substantial roof to cover them, in
England life was taking a more ornamental aspect.
Charles II., indolent and fond of luxury, came to the
throne in 1660. Two years later he married Catherine
of Braganza, a Portuguese princess, and both of them
introduced a more elegant style of living; his French
and her Spanish training leading them to require more
comforts than had hitherto been known in England.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Figure 9. CANE CHAIR, FLEMISH STYLE.</p>
</div>

<p>Among other things which were exported from
Holland was cane furniture of a superior quality. It
became very much the fashion, and was in Spanish or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Flemish styles, both of which were copied or adapted
by English cabinet-makers. Some of this furniture
found its way to America, and there are pieces to be
found showing all three styles, Flemish, Spanish, and
English adaptation. In <a href="#Page_23">Figure 8</a> is shown an example
of the English treatment of the Spanish style, at least
as to foot; while the flat underbrace is English, the
curved back and bandy leg are quite Dutch. The
carving on the top is very beautiful, and the knees of
the front legs carved, not with the usual shell, but
with heads, and below these an oval with moulding.
This chair is in the South Kensington Museum, London,
and dates from about 1680. The wood is walnut,
and the scrolls and foliage on the back stand out in
high relief; the seat, originally as now, is covered with
a rich brocade, with fine brass nails and a fringe.</p>

<p>The second chair is one of about the same period,
of very beautifully carved oak, and not restored. The
arms are missing, but show the places where they
originally were. It has lost its feet, but the exquisite
carving on the underbrace and top is still quite intact
and quite Italian in style. This chair is at the Waring
Galleries, London.</p>

<p>A very splendid example of the Flemish treatment
of the same style is shown in <a href="#Page_24">Figure 9</a>, the oak woodwork
being carved and turned, and the foot turning
out in true Flemish style. The date of the chairs
shown in both Figures 8 and 9 is prior to 1700.</p>

<p>The wealthy people of Charles II.'s time all indulged
in these chairs. Before that period stools had
been in general use, and only the master, mistress, or
guest of honour occupied the few chairs possessed in a
household.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>In New England centres like Salem, Boston, or
New Haven, even before the time of Charles II., there
was in some of the houses comfort as we understand
it. Mr. George Lamberton, of the New Haven Colony,
sailed in 1646 to England upon business in the
"Great Ship." She was never heard from again, and
her loss crippled the little colony almost beyond
belief. Mr. Lamberton's inventory shows a variety of
items. He had as many as eighty napkins; bedding
and table, chimney and board cloths in proportion;
feather and down beds with their accompanying hangings.
These with more than a dozen cushions to make
soft the stiff chairs and settles, silver plate, four chests,
ten boxes and trunks, eleven chairs, five stools, and
three tables, both round and square, made up comfortable
furnishings for a house with probably not more
than four rooms. The colonists were not only "plain
people," but there were those who came, shortly after
the first settlement, who brought with them the
household goods and clothes to which they had been
accustomed. The "Journal of the Pilgrims at Plymouth"
tells not only of the stress of living and the
struggle with Indians and forest creatures. There
was time to reprehend the frivolities of women's wear,
and the pastor's wife was the chief offender in the
matter of over-gay apparel. She was a young widow
when Mr. Johnson married her, and brought goodly
estate and personal belongings to her second husband.
She continued to wear the clothes she had brought
with her, and the chief exceptions were taken to the
cork-soled shoes she wore, and the whalebone in the
bodice and sleeves of her gown. Both the pastor and
his wife seem to have been more than reasonable, since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
they were willing to reform the cut of their garments
as far as they could "without spoiling of them."</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Figure 10. TURNED AND CARVED ARM CHAIR</p>
</div>

<p>While the general habit of the Puritans was to keep
their houses and apparel extremely plain, yet here and
there among them bits of comfort and elegance would
crop out. Among the stiff and straight-backed chairs,
one with stuffing would be found, while in the more
luxurious and easy-going South they were not so
rare. The covering probably was "sett work or
Turkey work;" but then, too, brocade ones were
found, and such a chair as is shown in <a href="#Page_27">Figure 10</a> would
be an ornament in any home. It is a fine example of
walnut-wood, turned and carved with bannister back
and stuffed seat. The covering has been restored,
but is of a pattern which was of the period. The
out-turned Flemish foot is more ball-like in shape than
is often seen, but it has the bowed knees which are so
familiar.</p>

<p>Yet, if the chairs were none too comfortable, there
were few families in any of the settlements that
did not own at least one feather bed. If not feathers,
then "flock beds" were used, that is chopped rags, or
feathers and flock mixed, or, as a last resort, the down
from the brown soft, cat-tails which grew plentifully
in every marsh was utilized instead of more costly
material.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br /><small>DUTCH FURNITURE.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Singleton</span>, in her exhaustive book "Furniture
of Our Forefathers," says that probably the first pieces
of furniture that were landed on the shores of the
Hudson came in the ship <i>Fortune</i>, and were brought
by Hendrich Christiansen, of Cleep, who founded a
little settlement of four houses and thirty persons in
1615. A little later came the <i>Tiger</i>, <i>The Little Fox</i>,
and the <i>Nightingale</i>, all bringing colonists and their
household furniture. The early Dutch settlers were
better fitted to start an infant colony than their New
England brothers. The Dutch were ever colonizers
and knew just how to plan and prepare a settlement.
The trouble with the Indians was not so constant as
it was with the New England colonies, although on
one occasion New Amsterdam was almost wiped out.
On the whole, the Dutch seem to have treated the
Indians more wisely, buying the lands of them and
having the purchase further confirmed by grants. In
New Amsterdam the settlers were comfortably fixed,
comparatively speaking, long before the New England
colonists were, for they had a sawmill in operation as
early as 1627, the machinery for which had been sent
from Holland, and which was worked by wind-power.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig011.jpg" alt="Figure 11. DUTCH FURNITURE, CALLED 'QUEEN ANNE'." width="374" height="600" />
<p class="caption">Figure 11. DUTCH FURNITURE, CALLED "QUEEN ANNE".</p>
</div>

<p>The Dutch settled at Albany and its neighbourhood
and around Schenectady, as well as those at New
Amsterdam, had many creature comforts. In 1643
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Albany was a colony of about one hundred persons
living in about thirty rough board houses. By 1689
the number of inhabitants had increased to 700 and
the houses to 150. During the next ten years the
improvements were rapid and wonderful; gardens
grew, filled with flowers and fruit; the class of houses
improved; wealthy merchants came to such a rich
market (of furs chiefly); and the Dutch city grew
apace, and the fine beaver-skins which were so plenty
bought luxuries for the pioneers. That luxury is not
too strong a word to use is shown by the splendid
carved kas shown in <a href="#Page_29">Figure 12</a>, which now belongs to
the Albany Historical Society, and is a piece of furniture
which may date back as far as the last quarter of
the seventeenth century. It is made of walnut, and
stands over eight feet high, with cupboard and shelves.
While this chest was of unusual beauty, there was a
certain solidity and ponderous character observable in
most of the Dutch furniture. It is characteristic of
the people themselves and is noted in everything
belonging to them. Their very ships had long, high-sounding
names, <i>The Angel Gabriel</i>, <i>The Van Rensselaer
Arms</i>, <i>King David</i>, <i>Queen Esther</i>, <i>King Solomon</i>,
<i>The Great Christopher</i>, <i>The Crowned Sea-Bears</i>, and
brought in their flat hulks fine goods from all quarters.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Figure 12. CARVED KAS.</p>
</div>

<p>The dress of the portly Dutch <i>vrouw</i> was in unison
with her cleanliness and love of thrift, for her gown&mdash;whether
of cloth, or her very bettermost one of silk&mdash;was
cut short enough to well clear the ground, and
showed her shoes with shining buckles, and her bright-coloured
stockings, often clocked with her favorite
flower, the tulip. The hair was drawn back from the
brow, smoothed and flattened and covered with a cap
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
which, among the wealthy, was bordered with Flanders
lace, and in any case was fluted, plaited, and
snowy white.</p>

<p>The practical education which the Dutch women
always obtained in their own country sharpened their
judgment, and the laws which permitted her to hold
real estate and carry on business in her own name,
even if a married woman, gave her an added independence.
It was no unusual thing for women to engage
in business on their own account and to carry it on
without the aid or interference of the men of the
family. At home in the Low Countries, the women
had sold at the market, beside the produce of the
gardens and poultry yards, the products of their own
industry as well,&mdash;laces, linen, cloth of wool, etc., and
as early as 1656 they sought and obtained permission
to hold their market in the new country as they had
in the old. Curaçao provided for them many luxuries,
such as "lemons, parrots, and paroquettes," besides a
variety of liquors. The women grew flax in their own
door-yards for the finest linen, and every house had its
spinning-wheel.</p>

<p>Hospitality was dispensed at these homes, supper
being a favorite meal, and as "early to bed and early
to rise" was a national motto the guests were expected
to come early and to leave early also,&mdash;nine
o'clock verging on riotous dissipation. Madam Steenwych
was noted for her suppers, which were more
substantial than the waffles and tea which was the
usual menu. In 1664, after her husband's death, she
married Dominie Selyns. At this time she had in her
living-room twelve Russia leather chairs, two easy-chairs
with silver lace, one cupboard of fine French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
nut-wood, one round and one square table, one cabinet,
thirteen pictures, one dressing-box, cushions, and curtains.
Her chairs with silver lace may have well been
like the handsome pair of marquetry ones shown in Figure
13. The seat of the side chair is entirely gone, but
the arm-chair yet retains a portion of its cover of wool
plush, no doubt the original one, since some of the
stuffing protrudes, and it is dried sea-kale instead of
hair. The wood is maple with an inlay of satin-wood.
These chairs belong to the Museum connected with
Cooper Institute, New York, which is being carefully
gathered by the Misses Hewitt.</p>

<p>Property had become valuable, and loss had been
sustained by fire, so in August, 1658, 250 leather fire-buckets
for public use were ordered from Holland, together
with hooks and ladders. In addition each
household was required to have a certain number of
buckets of their own, which were to be kept hanging
under the back stoop.</p>

<p>In 1686 a rich Dutch burgher in New Amsterdam
owned a house of eight rooms over cellars filled, no
doubt, with choice liquors and schnapps, and the rooms
above set out with chairs and tables, cabinets, cupboards
and a "great looking-glass." Ornaments were
there, too,&mdash;alabaster images and nineteen gaily
decorated porcelain dishes. Nor was the house suffered
to want for thorough cleansing, as there were
thirteen scrubbing and thirty-one rubbing brushes,
twenty-four pounds of Spanish soap, and seven other
brushes. With an increase of prosperity our Dutch
housewives lost no whit of their notions of cleanliness,
for here is a housecleaning described, presumably by
a victim, a hundred years later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The husband gone, the ceremony begins. The walls are
stripped of their furniture; paintings, prints, and looking-glasses
lie in huddled heaps about the floors; the curtains are torn from
their testers, the beds crammed into windows; chairs and tables,
bedsteads and cradles crowd the yard; and the garden fence
bends beneath the weight of carpets, blankets, cloth cloaks, old
coats, under-petticoats, and ragged breeches. This ceremony
completed, and the house thoroughly evacuated, the next operation
is to smear the walls and ceilings with brushes dipped into
a solution of lime called whitewash; to pour buckets of water over
the floor and scratch all the partitions and wainscots with hard
brushes charged with soft soap and stone-cutter's sand."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even these thrifty pioneers did not all accrue many
goods, for 1707, when Hellegonda De Kay, of New
York, came to make her will, she was obliged to leave
her "entire worldly estate" to one daughter. It consisted
of one Indian slave. The Dutch wife had an
equal interest with her husband in disposing of household
goods and furniture. She was always consulted,
and sometimes she even signed the will with her husband.
The wives of the English settlers, whether
Quaker or Puritan, did not have the rights of their
Dutch sisters in the ownership of household goods.
The wife's dowry passed into her husband's hands at
marriage, and remained there until his death, as the
inventory of the estate of Alexander Allyn of Hartford,
Conn., who died in 1708, testifies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Estate that deceased had with his wife Elizabeth in marriage
(now left to her).</i>"</p>

<p>"One round table; bed with furnishings; chest of drawers;
two trunks; a box; books; earthenware; glasses; pewter platters;
plates; bason; porringers; cups; spoons; tinware; a fork;
trenchers; four chairs; nine pounds in silver money; table-cloths;
napkins; towels; a looking-glass; a chest; a silver salt;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
porringer; wine-cup and spoon; a brass pot; an iron pot; two brass
skillets and hooks."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following extract from a will drawn in 1759 by
a man eighty years old shows the Friend's point of
view as to whom the household stuff belonged. He
wills to his wife as long as she liveth, unless she marries
again (she was seventy years old at the time),</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"two good feather beds and full furniture, and all my negro bedding;
and all my grain, either growing or cut, or in store at the
time of my decease; and all my flax and wool, and yarn and new
cloth and cattle hides, leather, and soap, and meat, and all other
provisions which I have in store in my house, either meat or drink,
and all my negro men and one of my negro women, such of them
as she shall choose, and my negro girl named Priss; and if I
should chance to dye when I have cattle a-fatting my wife shall
have them for the provision of herself and family, at my wife's
disposal."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No doubt the feather beds and "negro bedding," as
well as the "new cloth," had been made by the patient
fingers of this wife of fifty years' standing; but she
must forfeit all this fruit of her labour should she
marry again. The Dutch system seems preferable.</p>

<p>In another inventory, that of Charles Mott, also a
Long Island Quaker, dated 1740, the eldest son has the
house and homestead, "together with the negro boy
Jack and one feather bed." The sole provision for
his wife was "four pounds a year" to be paid to her
by the eldest son "so long as she remains my widow."
He seems to have put a premium on her filling his
place, and that quickly.</p>

<p>Possibly our Dutch settlers were more notable house
wives than their sisters in New England or the South.
In the latter region the mistress did not contribute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
with her own hands to the cleanliness of her home,
but she had onerous duties in overlooking the work of
sometimes over a hundred negroes, seeing to their
food, clothes, and shelter. Our New England wives
were still suffering from Indian depredations, and the
young housewives whose doors were driven thick with
nails to repel the deadly tomahawk, as Mistress David
Chapin's was at Chicopee in 1705, would probably not
have risked her "goods" out of doors, as did the
Dutch housewives at Albany.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 13. MARQUETRY CHAIRS.</p>
</div>

<p>The Dutch kitchen utensils seem numerous and
varied. Possets, pans, jack-spits, strainers and skillets
were seen in inventories as well as the more familiar
pots and kettles. The prosperous Dutch at home had
sent out and brought back many a rich argosy, and
silks and tissues, porcelains and lacquers, carved ivory
and fantastic carved wood, spices and plants had been
brought to Holland and found their way to America.
There were many ships unloaded at New York filled
with spoils from the East, which were eagerly bought
up. There was a variety of moneys current,&mdash;beaver-skins;
wampum; Spanish pistoles, worth 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>;
Arabian chequins at 10<i>s.</i>; "pieces of eight" (as the
Spanish reals were called), which, if they weighed 16
pennyweight (except those of Peru) passed for 5<i>s.</i>; and
French crowns worth 5<i>s.</i> Peruvian pieces of eight
and Dutch dollars were valued at 4<i>s.</i>, and all English
coin passed "as it goes in England." These were the
values in 1705, but they varied somewhat, the currency
being inflated by one governor, though his act created
such a disturbance that he was obliged to withdraw it.
The Long Island Dutch seem to have had less rich
belongings than those up the Hudson and about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Albany. Around Jamaica and Hempstead were stout
clapboard and shingle houses, but the inventories are
not lavish. Daniel Denton, writing in 1670 "A Brief
Description of New York," says this about his dearly
loved Hempstead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"May you should see the woods and Fields so curiously
bedeckt with Roses and an innumerable multitude of delightful
Flowers not only pleasing to the eye but smell. That you may
behold Nature contending with Art and striving to equal if not
excel many gardens in England."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But he has little to say about the way of living, except
that it is "godly."</p>

<p>The records of New Amsterdam, which are so wonderfully
complete, show what a valuable assistant to
these first settlers was the powerful West India
Company. By 1633 there were five stone houses containing
the Company's workshops; and as the land
near at hand was poor,&mdash;"scrubby" the Dutch farmers
called it,&mdash;they spread out to the neighbouring
New Jersey, Long Island, Gowanus, and East River
shores and from 1636 to 1640 were busy with their
settlements.</p>

<p>By 1651 New Amsterdam was prosperous enough to
have a brick house so good and well built as to be
worth 5,195 florins (about $2,100 of our money). In
1649 Adam Roelantsen, a general factotum of the West
India Company, whose name constantly appears in
the town records, (as he was unfortunately addicted to
strong waters, and under these conditions was very
quarrelsome and aggressive,) owned the following
house. It was a clapboard structure covered with a
reed roof, and eighteen by thirty feet in size. It
stood gable end toward the street, and at the front
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
door was the usual "portal" with its wooden seats.
Outside of the frame the chimney of squared timber
was carried up, while within the fireplace had a mantelpiece
and the living room had "fifty-one leaves of
wainscot." There was a bedstead or state-bed built
in, but of the movables no record is left. In reading
these old records it is noticed that matters moved
quickly; not much time was spent in grief and repining;
and to illustrate we give the experience of one
woman whose career does not seem to have excited
any comment among her contemporaries. In 1685
William Cox married a young woman named Sarah
Bradley, who had come from England with her
father and brothers to settle in New Amsterdam.
She was said to have been handsome and dashing, and
certainly she needed spirit to carry her through her
subsequent career. Four years after her marriage her
husband met with the following accident, thus
described by a political opponent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Mr. Cox, to show his fine clothes, undertook to goe to Amboy
to proclaime the King, who, coming whome againe, was fairely
drowned, which accident startled our commanders here very
much; there is a good rich widdow left. The manner of his being
drowned was comeing on board a cannow from Capt Cornelis'
Point at Staten Islands, goeing into the boate, slipt down betwixt
the cannow and the boate, the water not being above his chin, but
very muddy, stuck fast in, and, striving to get out, bobbing his
head under, receaved to much water in. They brought him ashore
with life in him, but all would not fetch him againe."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The good rich "widdow" whom he left soon
changed her loneliness for the pleasures of married
life, this time with Mr. John Oort. He, too, made a
brief stay, for by May 16, 1691, the widow Sarah Oort
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
had the necessary license under colonial law for her marriage
to no less a person than Captain William Kidd.
They lived comfortably in a house left by Sarah's first
husband, Mr. Cox (who left her with an estate of
several thousand pounds) till Captain Kidd set out
on his notable voyage in the "Adventure." The
goods which Mrs. Oort had at the time of her marriage
to Captain Kidd were the following: fifty-four chairs,
of Turkey work and double and single nailed; five
tables with their carpets (covers); four curtained beds
with their outfits; three chests of drawers; two
dressing-boxes; a desk; four looking-glasses; two
stands; a screen; a clock; andirons; fire-irons; fenders;
chafing-dishes; (3) candlesticks of silver, brass,
pewter, and tin; leather fire-buckets; over one hundred
ounces of silver plate; and a dozen glasses.
The screen, no doubt, was such a one as is shown in
the same figure, <a href="#Page_2"></a>No. 14, as the Dutch cradle, which
was used for many years in the Pruyn family, of
Albany. The third object in the picture is what is
known as a church stool, and was useful in keeping
the good <i>vrouw's</i> feet off the cold floors. This stool
is painted black and is dated 1702. There is a lurid
picture of the Last Judgment painted on it, and also a
verse in Dutch, which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The judgment of God is now at hand. There is still time; let
us separate the pious from the wicked and entreat God for the
joy of heaven."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All these articles are now at the rooms of the Historical
Society, Albany.</p>

<p>William Kidd was executed in May, 1701, and,
nothing daunted by her matrimonial ventures, Sarah
took as her fourth husband, in 1703, Christopher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Rousby, a man of considerable influence in the colony.
She lived until 1745, and left surviving her four children.</p>

<p>While the houses were rough, some with but two
rooms, yet articles even of luxury were there and
offered for sale. As early as 1654 a casket inlaid with
ebony was sold and brought thirty beavers and nineteen
guilders. Cornelis Barentsen sued Cristina Capoens
in 1656 for payment for a bed he sold her, payment
to be made in fourteen days. The price was six
beavers (about $57.00), which Cristina seemed unable
to pay, but which payment was ordered by the court.
In June, 1666, the administrators of the estate of the
late Jan Ryerson sold some "beasts" (horses, calves,
and hogs), as well as furniture at public sale. "The
payment for the beasts, also the bed, bolsters, and
pillows," was to be made in "whole merchantable
beavers, or otherwise in good strung seewant, beavers'
price, at twenty-four guilders the beaver."</p>

<p>Here is the inventory of a bride who was married at
New Amsterdam in 1691, and although her husband
was a man of consideration and some wealth it was
deemed of sufficient importance to record.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A half-worn bed; one pillow; two cushions of ticking, with
feathers; one rug; four sheets; four cushion-covers; two iron
pots; three pewter dishes; one pewter basin; one iron roster; one
schuryn spoon; two cowes about five years old; one case or cupboard,
one table."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>August 31, 1694, Jan Becker's inventory entered at
Albany, New York, showed a long list. Besides
abundant household goods he had&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A silver spoon; 3 pr. gold buttons; 5 doz. &amp; 10 silver buttons
for shirts; &amp; 2 silver scnuffies."</p>

<p>It is not difficult to picture in the mind how these
old Dutch houses looked when the living-room was
made snug and warm of a winter's evening. At various
places along the Hudson and on Long Island
there are still standing some of these old, low-ceiled,
wooden houses, with sloping roof and great chimney.
The furniture was generally of oak (particularly if it
had been brought from home) and carved. The most
important objects in the room are the mantelpiece and
the bed, the former of carved wood, its ornate character
significant of the wealth of the owner, and its size
seldom less than the height of the room. The bed
was frequently built in the room, a sort of bunk, hung
with curtains often of bright chintz, though, judging
from the inventories, "purple calico" curtains were
immensely popular, just as this same fabric is beloved
to-day by the pretty maid-servants one sees tripping
through the quaint old streets of Holland. There
were stools; not many chairs; tables, one or two;
each with its bright carpet or cover; racks on the wall
for what delft the mistress had; and below it the
treasured spoons. In the great kas, which took up a
large portion of the room, was the linen, covers for
tables, side-tables, shelves, etc., and all the napkins and
choice belongings of the housewife. If this kas was
carved oak it sometimes stood on a frame; sometimes
it had ponderous locks. If it was painted or inlaid
wood it might reach nearly to the floor, and then
stand upon large ball feet. Some of these kas were
so large and heavy that it was almost impossible to
move them, and there is the record of one <i>vrouw</i> who
upon moving from Flatbush was obliged to abandon
hers, leaving it behind her and selling it for £25:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Van Rensselaer family is a marriage kas
which goes back to the beginning of the eighteenth
century. It was imported from Holland by the
parents of Katherine Van Brugh, who wished their
only daughter to have everything that money could
buy, and during her early years it was being filled with
linen and household goods woven under her father's
roof. It was no light task to fill this great chest, for
it stood seven feet high and proportionally wide. It
is of carved oak, has many drawers and receptacles,
and will hold the silver and finery of the mistress,
while there are secret drawers for "duccatoons and
jacobuses." The keyhole is concealed under a movable
cover of carved wood, which looks like a part of
the carving when dropped in place. The ponderous
key is of iron and has many wards.</p>

<p>If the family was quite well to do and owned a good
stock of clothes, there would be one or more smaller
cases, or chests, in which these were stored away.
Much furniture was made here by Dutch workmen,
who followed the fashions of their native land. They
found abundant material, and more was brought into
the country,&mdash;in devious ways sometimes, but still it
came.</p>

<p>The court records for New Amsterdam for 1644
report a bark, <i>Croisie</i>, of Biscay, which was brought
into the harbour as a prize by the ship <i>La Garce</i>,
being laden with sugar, tobacco, and ebony. The
claim of the master of the <i>La Garce</i> was granted,
and the goods sold.</p>

<p>Nearly always there was a little silver,&mdash;spoons,
mugs, and a salt-cellar; and, as years passed on, much
coin was beaten by some member of the family (for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
there were many Dutch silversmiths) into tankards,&mdash;splendid
heavy vessels, capable of holding a quart,
with cover and thumb-piece, and showing the marks
of the mallet on the bottom and inside, for all of these
pieces of plate were hand-made. Waiters and massive
bowls were seen in nearly every family of easy circumstances,
and they scarcely ever went out of the family,
as it was a matter of pride to retain them. Much of
this fine old plate is treasured to-day by descendants
of its former owners. It has survived better than the
furniture, indestructible as that seemed.</p>

<p>In 1739 Lowrens Claesen, of Schenectady, had,
among other property, a gold seal ring and a silver
cup marked "L. V. V." Myndert Fredricksen of
Albany County, New York, blacksmith, left in 1703 a
great silver tankard, a church book with silver clasps
and chains, and a silver tumbler marked "M. F." A
blacksmith in those days meant a worker in iron, and
this one must have been prosperous, for he owned his
house and land, and furniture as well as silver.</p>

<p>But even if silver were lacking there were brass
skillets and warming-pans, and pewter was the ordinary
table furniture, which was scoured to a polish little
short of silver. One or two pieces of brightly decorated
Delft ware was the crowning glory of the housewife's
treasures, and far too precious for every-day use. So
holes were drilled in the edge, and a stout cord passed
through, so that it could be hung upon the wall.
There was, of course, a clock also, and leather chairs.
Nicholas Van Rensselaer, of Albany, who died in
1679, was a wealthy and important member of the
colony of Albany. His house had two beds, two
looking-glasses, two chests of drawers, two tables, one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
of oak and one of nut-wood; also a table of pine, as
well as six stools of the same; a sleeping-bunk or built-in
bed, over twenty pictures, a desk, and, of course,
brushes and kitchen utensils. These goods were disposed
of through four rooms. Not only were all the
necessaries abundant, but some very elegant furniture
came in with almost every ship, and even before 1700,
ebony chairs, boxes and cabinets are mentioned in the
inventories; but such splendid pieces as the cabinet
shown in <a href="#Page_42">Figure 15</a>, with carved panels in the doors,
and carved twisted legs, were only occasionally to be
met with. The doors conceal shelves, and above are
two drawers with drop handles. There are pieces
similar to this to be found in the United States in
private houses as well as in museums. This cabinet
belongs to the Waring Galleries, London.</p>

<p>Children slept in trundle beds, which during the day
were pushed under the large bed, often a four-post
bedstead when not the sleeping-bunk. One thing was
found in every house, rich or poor, and this was some
means for striking fire. Tinder and steel, with scorched
linen, were an indispensable part of every household.
Sometimes it was necessary to borrow coals from a
neighbour, and there were stringent town laws ordering
that "fire shall always be covered when carried
from house to house." In the "Court Records of New
Amsterdam" one of the earliest laws regulated the
carrying about of hot coals, and several Dutch <i>vrouws</i>
were hauled to court for breaking them.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 15. EBONY CABINET.</p>
</div>

<p>The furniture in these houses was by no means all
of Dutch or domestic make. They had what they
were able to get, and among painted kas and inlaid
chests would be Spanish chairs or stools, and English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
walnut beds with serge hangings, folding tables and
Turkey-work chairs. Before the close of the seventeenth
century there came direct to New York Dutch
ships from the Orient, or from the Low Countries
themselves, loaded with rich goods, among which was
much furniture. Styles had begun to change a little;
the Dutch were absorbing ideas from the Chinese and
copying and adapting forms and decorations. Beautiful
lacquer work was coming in, and splendid inlaid
or marquetry work; not any more in two colours, as
was the earliest style, but in a variety of colours and in
divers patterns, and standing upon bandy legs with
ball and claw, or what is known as the Dutch foot,
instead of the straight or turned leg.</p>

<p>The inventories show how far East Indian goods
were coming in, and there is frequent mention of
"East India baskets," boxes, trunks, and even cabinets.
The most usual woods were black walnut, white
oak and nut-wood, which was hickory. Occasionally
pieces were made of olive-wood, or of pine-wood
painted black. Ebony was used for inlay and for
adornment for frames. Looking-glasses were mentioned
in nearly every list, the earliest coming from
Venice. By 1670 looking-glass was manufactured at
Lambeth, England, in the Duke of Buckingham's
works, and was not now so costly as to be seen only
among the wealthy. The cupboards were no longer
uniformly made with solid doors, but glass was introduced,
so that the family wealth of silver and china
could be easily seen. By 1727 mahogany is mentioned
occasionally in the inventories, and it could be bought
by those who were wealthy enough to afford it.</p>

<p>Probably the Spaniards were the earliest users of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
mahogany, followed by the Dutch and English. Furniture
made of this wood is known to have existed in
New York prior to 1700, and in Philadelphia a little
later. The old Spanish mahogany was a rich, dark,
heavy wood, susceptible of a high polish. It darkened
with age and was not stained. The new mahogany,
at least that which comes from Mexico, is of a light,
more yellow colour, and requires staining, as age does
not darken it. It is light in weight. The mere lifting
of a piece enables one to judge whether it is made
from Spanish wood.</p>

<p>The carpets referred to in nearly every inventory
were not floor-coverings, but table-covers,&mdash;small rugs,
no doubt, but far too precious to be worn out by
rough-shod feet walking over them. The floors were
scoured white, and were strewn with sand which showed
the artistic capacity of mistress or maid in the way it
had patterns drawn in it by broom-handle or pointed
stick. It was not until the middle of the century that
carpets became at all common, and even then they are
mentioned in the inventories as very choice possessions.
There were "flowered carpets," "Scotch ditto,"
"rich and beautiful Turkey carpets," and Persian carpets
also. The colonists traded with Hamburg and
Holland for "duck, checquered linen, oznaburgs, cordage,
and tea,"&mdash;goods appreciated by the housewife,
and which she could not make.</p>

<p>The festivities indulged in by the Dutch settlers
were generally connected with the table; they played
backgammon, or bowls when the weather was fine and
they could go out of doors. The cards they used
numbered seventy-three to the pack, and there was no
queen, her place being supplied by a cavalier who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
was attended by a hired man, and they both supported
the king. Cards were not popular, however, except
among the English settlers, and they followed the
home fashions.</p>

<p>After English rule had been dominant in the little
city of New Amsterdam for nearly fifty years the
larger number of the families was still Dutch, as a
collection of wills made at that period testifies. What
would be now domains worthy a prince&mdash;farms lying
in Nassau Island, as Long Island was then called, vast
tracts in New Jersey, and thousands of acres between
New York and Albany&mdash;were divided by these wills.
Such names as Killian Van Rensselaer, second lord of
the manor; Harmanus Rutgers, Philip Schuyler, Van
Cortlandt, Provoost, etc., are signed to these documents
but it is in the minor wills that we find the records of
the lives of the main body of the people. A feather
bed, one or more slaves, and the family Bible are the
bequests usually first specified, the Bibles in some
cases being very massive and ponderous affairs. Jarminaye
Sieurs, widow, 1709, bequeaths to her daughter
her Bible with silver clasps, in addition to her gold
rings and one half of her clothes. A grand-daughter,
Hilley Veghten, gets a "silver cup with two ears,"
and other grandchildren, bearing such interesting
names as Reynier, Simesse, and Gretie Veghten, get a
silver spoon each. In 1711 a fond mother leaves to
her daughter "the red and white worsted and linen
stockings," besides two pillows, two coverlids, a bed
and furniture.</p>

<p>A Hempstead yeoman is very careful to stipulate
that his daughter shall have&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"one feather bed, an iron pot, six plates, three platters, two basins,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
one drinking pot and one cupboard worth £3, and six chairs, six
sheep, and one table."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The price of the cupboard being specified shows that
it was held in great estimation, and it must have been
a handsome piece of furniture.</p>

<p>Only very occasionally do we find a record in the
inventories of a "bed chair," yet such were sometimes
found here early in the eighteenth century. One is
shown in <a href="#Page_44">Figure 16</a>. It is carved on the top and inlaid,
and covered with woollen plush,&mdash;not the original covering,
which no doubt was Turkey work. Two hinges
are shown on the front rail; the back lets down, and
a leg unfolds to support it; while the legs and arms
coming together make the centre firm. This unusual
piece is at the Museum connected with the Cooper
Institute, is of nut-wood or maple inlaid with tulip-wood,
with bandy legs and the well-known Dutch feet.</p>

<p>The Dutch settlers had other elegances which are
more rarely met with, such as walnut kas or chests,
inlaid with plaques, or rather small saucers and plates
of Oriental china. These were tall, with doors opening
their whole length, and stood on the great ball
feet which are so familiar. One such cabinet is in the
Metropolitan Museum, New York, and another is
owned by Mrs. Pruyn of Albany. In the former
example the plaques display flowers and birds in various
colours; in the latter are plain blue and white.</p>

<p>Of later manufacture were pieces of rich marquetry
in vari-coloured exotic woods upon mahogany. The
heavy foot was replaced by others, still turning out, to
be sure, in the Flemish fashion, but very ornate and
beautiful, and still further embellished with ornaments
in gilt. Such a piece, massive in shape, but enriched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
with much ornament, is shown in the desk depicted in
<a href="#Page_46">Figure 17</a>. It was never made for any of the humbler
houses of the Dutch settlers, but such a piece was
worthy to stand in the study of a wealthy patroon or
to belong to some "lord of the manor." This particular
desk, a very perfect example of its class, belongs
to the Waring Galleries, London.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<small>CHIPPENDALE.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> studying the various periods into which different
makes of furniture may be divided, the accentuating
of one point, say of ornaments or the structural peculiarities,
is noted, not as being sharply defined, but as
being a gradual growth. Chippendale did not originate
at first. Indeed, he hardly adapted, for the East
India trade had brought to market Chinese designs
which he used, and French furniture was so popular
that he copied bodily in his book such designs as
pleased him, although the term "French chairs," as
employed at this time, referred to their being upholstered
and not to the style or decoration. Thomas
Johnson published a book about the middle of the
eighteenth century, in which was a medley of French,
Gothic and Chinese designs, many of which have a
strong family likeness to Chippendale's. There was
also Matthias Lock, who began to publish his books
as early as 1740, dedicated to such "nobility as would
stand for him." These books included one on Pier
Frames, Girandoles, Tables, etc., also, one on Ornaments
and Sconces, all of which were characteristic
of what was considered desirable at this time, and
which style Chippendale followed too. Ince &amp; Mayhew
published what they called a "Universal System
of Household Furnishing." They made many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
designs, over three hundred, and not only set forth
the fine taste in which they were conceived, but gave
the workmen directions for executing them. They
positively ran wild on "Chinese taste," their fretwork
and combination of Chinese and Gothic being perfectly
extravagant. Like Chippendale they designed
terms, or as we should call them pedestals, for busts,
toilet-tables, bookcases, many mirror-frames, and
chairs most intricate in their carved backs, with ribbon-work,
scrolls, and elaborate patterns in brass nails.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Figure 18. KITCHEN, WAYSIDE INN, SUDBURY, MASS.</p>
</div>

<p>What were known as "overdoors" were very carefully
designed by Chippendale, Ince &amp; Mayhew,
Robert Manwaring, and later by the Adam Brothers.
These overdoors were the wood or leadwork into
which glass was set, to go above front doors.</p>

<p>William Halfpenny, carpenter and architect, as he
called himself, published many works on Furniture,
Temples, Garden Seats, Windows, Doors, Obelisks,
etc., beginning in 1719. Among the many books are
these two, "Twenty New Designs of Chinese Lattice
and Other Works for Staircases, Gates, Failings, etc.,"
and also, "Chinese and Gothic Architecture." So
fond were the Halfpennys (for the son was later associated
with the father) of Chinese work that they
seldom missed an opportunity of putting in a Chinese
figure. On their ceilings, above the chimney-pieces&mdash;everywhere
that decoration could be crowded in,&mdash;one
is apt to find a Chinese mandarin with pigtail and
umbrella.</p>

<p>The originality of Chippendale soon spoke for itself.
He worked in so many styles, and has so grown in
estimation, that his name is made to cover the greatest
variety of designs. When he first came before the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
public his work met with much adverse criticism.
Isaac Ware, a contemporary, writes of him thus:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It is our misfortune at this time to see an unmeaning scrawl of
C's inverted and looped together, taking the place of Greek and
Roman elegance even in our most expensive decorations."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the early extravagances of his designs were soon
modified, and even they were touched with a grace
which made them pleasing to the eye while wholly
extravagant. His better and more familiar work is
to-day the model upon which cabinet-workers rely, no
one having arisen who can improve on his designs.
Thousands of pieces of furniture are called by his
name, both in this country and England, which were
not even contemporary with this maker and bear no
resemblance either to his designs or to work known to
be his.</p>

<p>About the time that Chippendale came on the field
(1750) it had become the custom for architects and
designers to publish catalogues of their designs.
Thomas Chippendale, a progressive business man, was
not behind his contemporaries, so in 1754 he published
his catalogue, which he called "The Gentleman's and
Cabinet-Maker's Director." It was a very successful
publication, passed through several editions, and
brought him added name and fame. It sold for £3
13<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and had fine copper-plate engravings. The
title page of Chippendale's "Director," specifies
designs for the following pieces of furniture:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Chairs, Sofas, Beds and Couches, China-Tables, Bason-Tables
and Tea-Kettle Stands, Frames for Marble Slabs, Bureau-Dressing-Tables,
and Library-Tables, Library Bookcases, Organ Cases
for Private Rooms or Churches, Desks and Bookcases, Dressing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
and Writing-Tables with Bookcases, Toilets, Cabinets, and
Clothes-Presses.</p>

<p>China-Cases, China-Shelves, and Book-Shelves, Candle-Stands
and Terms for Busts, Stands for China Jars and Pedestals, Cisterns
for Water, Lanthorns, and Chandeliers, Fire-Screens, Brackets
and Clock-Cases, Pier-Glasses and Table-Frames, Girandoles
Chimney-Pieces and Picture-Frames, Stove-Grates, Boarders,
Frets, Chinese-Railing and Brass-Work for Furniture."</p>
</blockquote>

<img src="images/fig019.jpg" alt="Figure 19. CHIPPENDALE CHAIRS" width="422" height="600" />
<p class="caption">Figure 19. CHIPPENDALE CHAIRS</p>
</div>

<p>At this period the best room or "saloon" was
wainscotted chair high, and the remainder prepared
for wall-paper, or battened for hangings of silk or
tapestry. Chippendale drew many beautiful designs,
which he calls "borders for paper-hangings," and
which were used as finishings at the top of the paper.
Some of them were also employed as patterns for
carving, or work in stucco painted and gilded.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that Chippendale was par
excellence a carver of wood, and so we find him working
almost exclusively in "solid mahogany," as we
have come to call it, which wood had been introduced
into England about the time of Raleigh (1595),
though it was not used to any extent as a material
for furniture until about twenty-five years before
Chippendale published his book. Indeed it seems to
have been used in America for this purpose quite as
soon as in England, although there are in that country
a few detached pieces of mahogany furniture made
late in 1600, showing that some wood had been
imported before Raleigh caused it to be brought in
more freely, along with "tabac" and the potato,
which latter vegetable was first grown at Sir Walter's
estate called "Youghal," near Cork, Ireland. Sir
Walter did not use the new wood in his own beautiful
house, but had splendidly carved oak chimney-pieces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
and furniture made by men whom he brought from
Flanders for that purpose.</p>

<p>At the time Chippendale published his book he was
about forty years old, as it is generally supposed that
he was born about 1710. Worcester is given as the
place of his birth, and authorities state that other
members of his family practiced the art of wood-carving
before him, but the information about his early
history is very scant. His shop was in St. Martin's
Lane, London, and he employed as many as a hundred
men, so it is rather strange that more authentic
specimens of his handiwork have not survived. While
mahogany was the wood which he used chiefly for
his furniture, he employed a close-set pine for carving
many of the beautiful floriated mirror-frames for
which he was so justly celebrated. Scrolls, flower
and leaves, falling water, and a particular bird of his
own fancy, with a long and prominent beak, were
employed in the decoration of these mirrors, which
were richly gilded, the ornament being entirely of
wood without the addition of porcelain plaques or
metal work, which was such a feature of the French
furniture of this period, the influence of which is
noticeable in many of Chippendale's designs. It is
true that he did not carry out some of his designs,
notably such pieces as the state beds, etc., after the
style of Louis XV. One glance at the "Director"
will show how impossible these beds were. The top,
supported on posts, rises like Ossa upon Pelion piled,
with layers or terraces of carved figures of children,
rock-work, and everything else, the whole
crowned by groups consisting of several figures and
animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig020.jpg" alt="Figure 20. CHIPPENDALE CHAIR." width="390" height="600" />
<p class="caption">Figure 20. CHIPPENDALE CHAIR.</p>
</div>

<p>His designs for bedposts show the French influence,
being fluted and wreathed with flowers. Many stand
flat on the ground without ornamental feet, and are
plain on top to support a canopy or tester.</p>

<p>Most successful of all the furniture designed by
this maker are the chairs, many of them decorated
with graceful scroll-work and delicate garlands of
flowers, though the styles with which we are most
familiar are massive, heavy pieces with carving upon
them, and either with or without solid underbraces.
A unique piece is shown in <a href="#Page_53">Figure 20</a>. This chair is
thought to have been imported into this country about
1760, but I should suppose it to be a very much earlier
example of Chippendale's work, while he was still content
to copy, for the front legs show the bear's paw
while the rear ones are the familiar Dutch foot.</p>

<p>It belongs to the South Carolina College, at Columbia,
S. C. and was given to it by General Preston
about 1850. In his letter of presentation he calls it
"the quasi throne of the Colonial Governors of South
Carolina," but beyond this its history is unknown.
This chair is of solid mahogany as most of these chairs
were, and shows about the edges of the carving traces
of the chisel-marks, a not at all unusual feature in
these old hand-carved pieces. The splat (<i>i. e.</i> the central
part of the back) is plainly pierced. The term
"cabriole", which we apply now to the leg, in Chippendale's
time referred to a chair having a stuffed
back. It has generally been supposed that Chippendale
was the originator of the ball-and-claw foot, which
is of two varieties, but he copied this style of decoration
directly from the Dutch. The foot in this
chair is what is known as the "bear's paw", so called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
from the fur which is rudely carved above the foot.
The other style being the "bird's claw." The chairs
with cabriole legs were called bandy or bow-legged
when they first came into use, about 1700, which is
also about the time that easy-chairs were first used
in bedrooms. Up to that date chairs had been rather
severe and of the nature of stools and settles. As
writing became better learned there was a demand
for dainty and ornamental desks for ladies' use, as well
as library desks for men, and bookcases were also
needed.</p>

<p>In Chippendale's book, "The Gentleman's and
Cabinet-Maker's Director", while there are designs
given for every imaginable piece of furniture, there is
not a single illustration of the ball-and-claw or hoof foot;
yet it is known by authentic pieces, coming down as
late as 1780, and preserved in the South Kensington
Museum, London, that such work was done by him.
Further than this, we are used to consider mahogany
as pre-eminently the wood he worked in, yet in this
same guide this wood is mentioned by him but once.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Six designs of chairs for Halls, Passages, or Summer-houses.
They may be made either of mahogany or any other wood, and
painted, and have commonly wooden seats."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All this fine solid mahogany furniture made by
Chippendale, and by which his name is so firmly
perpetuated, was regarded by him as merely commercial
work. What he really took a pride in was very
fussy, covered with upholstery, with an abundance of
carving and gilding, and even metal work on the
exposed parts. Rosewood was used by him also,
with elaborate carving which was sometimes embellished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
with gilt, or, in cases where great elegance was
demanded, by brass, copper, or silver mounts richly
chased. He turned out many pieces of soft wood
japanned or painted, and decorated also with gilt and
colours.</p>

<p>Little of this furniture ever came to America. It
was made to order for the nobility and gentry, and its
immense cost rendered it possible only for the very
wealthy. Among the two hundred copper-plate
designs given in Chippendale's book, quite a large
portion of them are in what is known as "Chinese
taste," which had taken the world of fashion by storm.
Sir William Chambers, who had travelled in China, is
given the credit for having introduced this style into
furniture and decoration, which was further adapted
by Chippendale and other makers, but it was
already known before Chambers's day. Both Chambers
and Robert Adam, the best architects of
their day, were Scotchmen. Chambers was born in
1726, and from his earliest years had a love for the
sea. This induced him to make a voyage to Canton,
where he made innumerable notes and sketches of
furniture, buildings, and gardens, which he made full
use of later. In 1759 he published his book "The
Decorative Part of Civil Architecture," which was
most successful. He was appointed drawing-master
to the Prince of Wales, afterward George III., and
managed to retain the royal favor for the rest of his
life. He not only designed many houses for wealthy
patrons and altered many others, but he was afterward
appointed landscape gardener at Kew, and knighted.</p>

<p>The older Chinese furniture which one sees in
Europe dates from the eighteenth century, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
made for and imported by the Dutch; hence the
medley of styles. Elaborate bedsteads, tables, and
cabinets were decorated with ivory figures in relief.
There is furniture of this description in the United
States, splendidly carved out of cedar and decorated
with hundreds of tiny figures of men and women
carved from ivory and set on. Such a piece is shown
in <a href="#Page_56">Figure 21</a>, the original of which is at Memorial
Hall, Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Not only was Chinese furniture in wood and wicker
brought from the Orient, but the Dutch, whom we
have come to look upon as ready imitators, followed
Oriental styles not only in furniture but in pottery as
well. Chippendale specifies nine of his designs for
chairs in Chinese style as proper for a lady's dressing-room,
especially if it were hung with an India paper.
They were likewise recommended for Chinese temples.
These chairs commonly have cane bottoms with loose
cushions, but if required may be stuffed and have
brass nails.</p>

<p>As early as 1711 Addison comments on the motley
confusion heaped up in a lady's library, where there
were few books but "Munkies, Mandarins, and Scaramouches"
without end; and to keep these ornaments
in countenance was also furniture made after Chinese
designs.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig021.jpg" alt="Figure 21. CARVED CEDAR TABLE." width="401" height="600" />
<p class="caption">Figure 21. CARVED CEDAR TABLE.</p>
</div>

<p>Besides these styles Chippendale also used a modification
of the Gothic, notably in such places as the doors of
cabinets, or the doors and the tops of bookcases. Horace
Walpole, in his little Gothic villa at Strawberry
Hill, had awakened a still further taste for a revival of
Gothic designs; and everybody, to be in the mode,
had their cabinet doors and bookcases with embattled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
tops and Gothic tracery. Of all the styles Chippendale
adopted and adapted, this one left the least
enduring trace. More successful were his bookcases
based on Louis XV. style. They are of mahogany and
have the rococo ornaments peculiar to this style.
This work shows off gilding admirably. These bookcases
with drawers and desk, as well as the bureaus,
were used in bedrooms which were often boudoirs and
studies as well. So a receptacle which could be
quickly locked was quite necessary.</p>

<p>In Chippendale's catalogue are directions given for
many small articles which were much in demand and
highly fashionable when the book was written, but for
which the present day and generation has no use.
Such were the charming little tea-caddies with brass
handles and locks, stands for candles, or china jars or
animals with which the drawing-rooms of those days
were crowded. There were also carved brackets,
decorated with the bird we have spoken of before, and
exquisite foliated designs making graceful adornments
for any room, and often neglected in sales where
other and better-known examples of this period bring
fabulous prices. When carved in pine these brackets
are always gilded, but occasionally they may be obtained
in walnut and mahogany.</p>

<p>The designs for such pieces are largely original with
Chippendale, for their use had just become needed,
and we must remember besides that it was Chippendale's
misfortune to live in a transition period, and that
the rococo which preceded him, and by which his first
work was influenced, died very hard. Indeed his first
style might be called rococo, and the designs swelled
and bulged, were covered with meaningless and fantastic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
ornament, and ran riot through all styles and
countries. It had for its chief merit the fact that it
was executed with great delicacy and beauty and had
a grace about it which was always pleasing. The two
sides of a design are seldom alike, and the merit of
such pieces is due purely to the skill of the carver.
Yet it was under his skilful hand that later the beauty
of simplicity was once more proved, and he sought
classic models for his inspiration. Speaking himself
of designs for French chairs he says, "for greater
variety the feet and elbows are different." The
moulding around the bottom of the edge of the rails
also comes under his consideration, and he mentions
Spanish leather or damask as good material for covering
chairs.</p>

<p>He it was who exemplified the principle that each
part of a piece of furniture should be adapted to its
use, and that overloading an article with ornament did
not necessarily add to its beauty. After his rococo
period came the rage for Chinese designs, and lastly
the plain and solid style with which we are familiar.</p>

<p>Two very handsome chairs are shown in Figure
22, the side chair showing an abundance of exquisite
carving on the knees and in the splat. It is wonderful
what variety he encompassed working in the small
space and confined shape of this part of a chair. It
will be observed that in all the chairs shown no two
splats are alike.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Figure 22. CHIPPENDALE CHAIRS.</p>
</div>

<p>All the construction of the Chippendale furniture
of the last period is remarkably solid and of the first
order, and the wood is of a dark and rich mahogany.
The best pieces of this period are those in which the
originality of the designer had full play, and when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
he was not influenced by either the French or Oriental
taste. The furniture of this period, fine and free in
design, was well adapted to the fashions and mode of
life of the people for whom it was made. He retained
the roomy character of the Dutch furniture, which
was needed for the style of dress affected by both
sexes. The Spanish furniture of oak, with cane work
or leather, introduced by Catherine of Braganza, was
not the only innovation brought to England by that
lady, for Evelyn says in his "Diary" for May 30,
1662,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The Queene ariv'd with a traine of Portuguese ladies in their
monstrous fardingals or guard-infantas ... Her Majesty in the
same habit, her foretop long and curiously turn'd aside."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the next forty years fashions changed,&mdash;they
changed slowly in those days,&mdash;and among other
things laid at the door of "Good Queen Anne" may
be added the hoop-skirt. Flowered and damask
gowns were worn over it, and in the "Spectator" of
1712 a number of gowns are advertised for sale, all
the property of Mr. Peter Paggen, of Love Lane, near
Eastcheap, London. Among them is an "Isabella-coloured
kincob gown, flowered with green and gold;
a purple and gold Atlas gown with a scarlet and gold
Atlas petticoat edged with silver."</p>

<p>A little later in the century a lady's gown was all
ruffles and flounces, in fact "every part of the garment
was in curl, and caused a lady of fashion to look like
one of those animals which in the country we call a
Friesland hen."</p>

<p>The reigns of the first two Georges had Hogarth for
their illustrator, and in the set of drawings called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
"Marriage à la Mode" we see the hoods, skirts without
trains, unruffled and often accompanied by a
sack, or something between a cloak and a gown, and
called a mantua. During the reign of George I. there
was no queen to set the fashion, so it changed little.
In 1735 Caroline, queen of George II. on the king's
birthday appeared in a "beautiful suit made of silk of
the produce of Georgia, and the same was acknowledged
to excel that of any other country." The ladies
who accompanied her wore flowered silks of various
colours, of a large pattern, but mostly with a white
ground, with wide short sleeves and short petticoats.
These gowns were often pinned up behind in fantastic
fashion, and generally quite narrow. It was also <i>à la
mode</i> to wear gold or silver nets on the petticoats, and
to face and guard the robes with them and even to
wear them on sleeves. Lady Harcourt, a famous
beauty of Caroline's court, wore on one occasion a
"white ground rich silk, embossed with gold and
silver, and fine coloured flowers of a large pattern."</p>

<p>What we know as a morning-gown they called, in
the middle of the eighteenth century a nightgown,
and we read of a "garnet-coloured lustring nightgown
with a tobine stripe of green and white, trimmed with
floss of the same colour and lined with straw-coloured
lutestring." A gay garment truly.</p>

<p>These were the styles in vogue when Chippendale
began to design and make furniture for his patrons,
whom he desired to see among the most fashionable.
While the ladies were so gay, the gentlemen were
quite as elegant, with three-cornered hats, wigs and
patches, embroidered waistcoats, with stiffened
skirts to their coats, knee-breeches, silk stockings, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
snuff-boxes. Such modish people could not bestow
themselves comfortably in chairs with arms, so chairs
without arms, and tabourets, as they were called, were
quite necessary for comfort. The fashionable ailment
of the day, for men at least was gout, and we find
designs for "gouty stools," in which the top could be
raised or lowered as best suited the needs of the
patient. His designs for sofas made these articles of
great size; they ran from six feet nine inches to ten
feet long. His ideas as to decoration seem amusing,
for he mentions that the carvings on the sofa should be
emblematic of Watchfulness, Assiduity, and Rest.</p>

<p>Wine-coolers for which Chippendale made many
designs, sometimes had brass bands around them
which had the effect of making them look very heavy
and clumsy. Coolers of this style were round or oval,
but some of better design were oblong or square.
Numbers of beautiful little tea-tables, or tea-poys, as
they were often called, were also made by Chippendale,
and what he called in his book of designs
"candle stands" were no doubt sometimes put to
this use, though their height&mdash;he says they should run
from three feet six inches to four feet six inches,
rendered the taller ones awkward. <a href="#Page_63">Figure 23</a> shows
a very beautiful example of one of these stands richly
carved. The post is three feet seven and a half inches
high, and the hexagonal top has a standing rim of
very delicate carving. The little tea-stand next to it
has also a slight rim, and some carving on the pedestal
and feet. The music-stand is not a usual piece, and
has a cupboard and drawer to contain the sheets. All
three pieces are of mahogany and belong to the collection
at Memorial Hall, Philadelphia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Many of these tables or stands made their way to
America, for tea-drinking was a great resource for the
ladies. As early as 1720 Bohea tea was selling at
Philadelphia for thirty shillings a pound. Its great
cost prohibited its common use, and it was not until
much later that it became common, so the greatest
treat that could be offered to a neighbour was a drink
of tea, particularly if the proud housewife could serve
it out of a tiny porcelain cup without a handle, such
cups being almost as great a rarity as the tea.</p>

<p>The little rim which set up above the edge of the
table was intended to prevent the tea furniture from
falling off. These tables are occasionally seen in
America in their simpler forms. There are special
ones made to order for customers by Chippendale,
which are seldom allowed to leave the families for
which they were originally made. There are two
such tea-tables made in "Chinese taste" with fretwork
legs, sides to the table, and the little standing
rim to protect the china. One of these tables was
made for the great-grandmother of the present owner,
by Chippendale, and has come down in a state of perfect
preservation. It is held in England, is thirty-nine
and three-eighths inches high, the top is thirty-two by
twenty-one and five-eighths inches.</p>

<p>Chippendale, in his book, gives very elaborate directions
for preparing the wood from which this fretwork
carving was to be made. In order to have it as
strong as possible he advises the use of three thin sheets
of wood glued together, the grain to run in opposite
directions, and the fret carving to be made in this.
He particularly recommends this use of glued wood
for such pieces as China-Cases, which were largely
fretwork with pagodas on top and hanging ornaments at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
the sides.</p>

</div>

<p>Card-tables were also made in great varieties and
numbers by this same maker, and his graceful designs
were copied by other and less well-known makers, so
that these tables, at least in "Chippendale style," are
not uncommon. His card-tables were of two styles,
with leaves which folded together on top when not in
use, and a plain oblong table without leaves. As card-playing
was one of the most fashionable pursuits of
the day in England, which fashion was followed with
becoming promptitude by us. It is seen that many
of these tables were needed to accommodate the gay
world. Those most esteemed were the kind with
leaves, which could seat a larger party than the oblong
ones, and which, when not in use, could be folded
together and set against the wall. Both styles, when
made by Chippendale, were decorated only with carving.
During the last half of the eighteenth century
there were probably few families who did not own at
least one card-table.</p>

<p>Gambling at cards had always been an amusement
at courts, and there were many games in vogue.
Ombre had been introduced in the previous century
by Catherine of Braganza, and quadrille was another
favorite game of hers. Pepys under date of February
17, 1666-7, alludes to the fact that Catherine played
not only on week days but on Sundays as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This evening, going to the Queene's side to see the ladies, I did
find the Queene, the Duchesse of York, and another or two at
cards, with the room full of great ladies and men, which I was
amazed at to see of a Sunday, having not believed it, but contrarily,
flatly denied the same a little while since to my cosen Roger
Pepys."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>The next reign, that of James II., saw basset introduced,
and it retained its popularity through several
reigns and was still the mode when Queen Anne
occupied the throne. It broke "into her hours by
day as well as by night," and the drain on the privy
purse was excessive, for the queen was a good loser.
The Cocoa-Tree Club, at No. 64 St. James Street,
London, was, during Queen Anne's reign, a regular
gambling-den. Walpole says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Within this week there has been a cast at hazard at the Cocoa-Tree,
the difference of which amounted to £180,000."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By George II.'s reign cards were universal. The
preface to the "Court Gamster" says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Gaming has become so much the fashion that he who in company
should be ignorant of the games in vogue would be reckoned
low-bred and hardly fit for conversation."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Princess Amelia Sophia, daughter of George II.,
was an inveterate snuff-taker as well as gambler.
Horace Walpole, who was often invited to make one
at her card parties, has left many graphic pictures of
her. At Bath the card-tables were one of the chief
attractions, and the sums of money staked during a
single night seem prodigious. But of all the Georges,
George IV. had the most reckless propensities. Before
he was twenty-one years old he had lost £800,000, one
of his boon companions being that confirmed gamester,
Charles James Fox.</p>

<p>Almack's was a famous gambling-club, opened in
1764. The gamesters began by pulling off their velvet
and embroidered coats, putting on frieze garments,
and pulling leather sleeves over their lace ruffles.
High-crowned, broad-brimmed straw hats were worn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
to shade their eyes from the light, to keep their hair
from being tumbled, and perhaps to conceal their
emotions.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 24. CHIPPENDALE CARD-TABLE.</p>
</div>

<p>George II. was still on the throne when Chippendale
published his "Director," and in such a gambling age
it is no wonder that he made many card-tables in
order to please his patrons. Not alone at court were
they in demand, but one has only to read such transcripts
of the times as Jane Austen's or Miss Burney's
novels to find that nearly every country family sat
down of an evening to a quiet hand at cards. Following
at a distance, but as well as they were able,
the fashions set at court, Americans too played cards,
and Chippendale's tables were sent across the ocean
and were copied by colonial cabinet-makers, who by
this time had become very successful workers themselves.
Contemporary letters, which describe the propensity
of the ladies to play loo all day as well as all
night were, no doubt, too extravagant. On the great
plantations at the South, gambling was said to be a
favorite diversion, and piquet, écarté, faro, hazard, and
basset were played, as well as less exciting games.
Besides the tables with plain polished surfaces, some
were covered with a green cloth. Others had pockets
to hold the counters, which were old silver Spanish
pieces or were made of mother-of-pearl. These tables
were valued highly, the early ones being walnut, the
later mahogany. In some of the inventories already
quoted mention is made of various styles of playing-cards
which were imported by the gross, as well
as "pearl fish," which were the fashionable counters.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Page_65">Figure 24</a> a very beautiful Chippendale card-table
is shown. It is of mahogany, richly carved on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
knees, and with a heavy carved moulding. It is unusual
in having five legs, one of which moves out to support
the second half of the top. The feet are ball-and-claw,
and within the lid is lined with cloth, has
depressions for counters, and also four flat panels, one
at each corner, where the candlesticks stood. It belongs
to Miss Sarah Frost, Rochester, N. Y., and has
been in her family over 100 years.</p>

<p>Most of Chippendale's furniture presents certain
characteristics that are easily mastered. First may be
mentioned the ball-and-claw foot, and the cabriole leg
which he adopted from the Dutch, and which he used
so freely before he introduced the straight leg. Then
the backs of his chairs are quite distinctive, whether
the splats run up and down, or become cross-braces, or
are elaborated into very ornamental ribbon-work.
The top bar is generally extended on each end into
what, for a better name, we will call "ears."</p>

<p>Chippendale never used inlay on any of his pieces,
preferring to produce the decoration by carving. In his
very ornate carvings we have mentioned the long-billed
bird, the falling-water effect, and the familiar ribbon-work
which is often introduced into backs with
such good effect. There are a number of patterns for
carving shown in the designs in his book, and used by
him over and over again, with which we have become
well acquainted. Little carved bands were quite universally
employed to decorate the rims of his card-tables,
and in his fine chairs the front bar of the seat
often had a shell or other ornament carved upon it.
The very finest chairs by this maker are seldom found
in America, though furniture was imported freely.
In Smith's "History of New York" for the year 1756,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
two years after Chippendale published his work, there
is the following statement:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig025.jpg" alt="Figure 25. CHIPPENDALE MARBLE-TOPPED TABLE." width="600" height="482" />
<p class="caption">Figure 25. CHIPPENDALE MARBLE-TOPPED TABLE.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>"In the City of New York, through our intercourse with Europeans,
we follow the London fashions, though by the time we
adopt them they become disused in England. Our affluence during
the late French war introduced a degree of luxury in tables,
dress, and furniture with which we were before unacquainted.
But still we are not so gay a people as our neighbours at Boston,
and several Southern colonies."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the first time possibly that the descendants of
the Pilgrims have gone on record as a "gay people."</p>

<p>When the seats of Chippendale's pieces are stuffed,
it will be noticed that the material is usually drawn
over the rails, and sometimes adorned with gilt-headed
nails set in a pattern or straight. See <a href="#Page_51">Figure 19</a>. He
says in his catalogue that he considers this the handsomer
fashion; but in some cases, where the seats were
covered with set work or crewel work, they were set in
the wooden frame. There are two such chairs made
by Chippendale and given by the fourth Duke of
Marlborough in 1790 to an ancestor of the present
owner. The seats of these ribbon-backed chairs were
worked by the famous Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough,
and are still in a fresh and blooming state of
preservation. These arm-chairs are very handsomely
carved, and rest on large ball-and-claw feet. The carving
is not confined to the knee alone, but runs down
the leg to the end of the claw. These are owned in
England.</p>

<p>That quantities of this furniture are changing hands
all the time is evident from reading the records of sales
which go on at all the large auction rooms in Europe.
It is safe to say that fully half of it comes to America,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and that it is possible to buy here choice specimens of
the works of all the famous cabinet-makers. Even the
well-known Battle Abbey has been despoiled, and
while much of the furniture was Flemish and German,
and not of particularly good quality, there were also
some pieces of both Chippendale and Adam Bros., the
latter being represented by several mirrors. Chippendale
chairs of undoubted authenticity bring easily at
these sales $200 each, while one of distinctly inferior
quality sold for $335, owing to the authenticity of its
history.</p>

<p>At a sale of furniture held within the year at Christie's,
in London, a genuine surprise was furnished when
a set of mahogany Chippendale chairs brought $5,225.
A few weeks later two chairs, apparently out of the
same set, appeared at another sale, also at Christie's
and about an hour before the sale they were withdrawn.
These chairs, says the catalogue, were given
by a lady to the vicar and church wardens of a parish
church in Lincolnshire. The lady died, and her executors
held that they were lent, not given, and the sale
was stopped until the rightful ownership should be
established by law. But there was also in the catalogue
still another chair which was said to belong to the
same set, yet which was of a different wood and more
boldly carved. This chair brought but a little more
than $100. The removal of the two previously mentioned
chairs from the sale, and the whole mystery
which surrounds them, has given rise to wild rumours,
and all kinds of reports are circulated which makes
one very cautious about buying at auctions. In fact
catalogues at auctions are little to be relied on, as one
will often find pieces heavy with inlay, or of undoubted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
American make, boldly marked Chippendale, while
Sheraton is made to shoulder the baldest imitations of
his style and design. It must always be a matter of
regret that furniture-makers so rarely signed their
work. If they had realized that individual specimens
would bring as much as fine paintings, they
would not have left their work clouded with an uncertain
pedigree.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig026.jpg" alt="Figure 26. CHIPPENDALE CHAIR-BACKS AND MIRROR-FRAME" width="600" height="363" />
<p class="caption">Figure 26. CHIPPENDALE CHAIR-BACKS AND MIRROR-FRAME</p>
</div>

<p>Chippendale did not make sideboards. He made
side or serving-tables but the sideboard was a later
growth, due largely to three cabinet-makers who succeeded
Chippendale,&mdash;Shearer, Hepplewhite, and
Sheraton, all of whom, like Chippendale, published
catalogues of their designs. The nearest approach
which Chippendale made to a sideboard was a table
with a shallow drawer for linen. He did not make
any of those pieces of furniture with drawers and cupboards
which are so often called by his name.</p>

<p>It may be seen that on Chippendale's title-page he
refers to "frames for marble slabs." These were generally
tables,&mdash;side or serving tables we should call
them,&mdash;and they were elaborately carved on legs and
edges. Nor were they unknown in this country, for
inventories as early as the middle of the eighteenth
century refer to sideboard tables with marble tops, as
well as marble-topped parlor tables.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Page_67">Figure 25</a> is shown an unusually elegant marble-topped
parlor table. The profuse carving is in Chippendale's
very best style, not flamboyant, but elegant
and graceful. On each of the long sides is a grotesque
mask, and the legs, carved over the knees with shells
and flowers in low relief, end in a ball-and-paw, the
hair on the foot being most delicately carved. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
wood is dark, rich mahogany; the marble top is of
brown tint with light veinings. This fine piece is at
Memorial Hall, Philadelphia.</p>

<p>To sum up, then, briefly, Chippendale's peculiarities
may be expressed as follows:</p>

<p>He used the ball-and-claw foot with the cabriole leg:
this was succeeded by the straight leg.</p>

<p>The tops of his chairs are almost invariably prolonged
into little ear-like ornaments.</p>

<p>He never used inlay on his furniture.</p>

<p>He used carving as ornament, generally worked in
solid mahogany for his larger pieces, and in a close-set
pine which was gilded for his smaller and ornamental
pieces.</p>

<p>Many of the gold-frame looking-glasses have the
glass pane divided by delicate ornament or pilasters.
This was to save expense, as in this way several small
panes of glass could be used instead of one large and
more costly one. The glass made in England was in
very thin plates, and the bevel was ground by hand, so
that it followed every twist and turn in the convolutions
of the frame which rested on it.</p>

<p>Strength, beauty, and adaptability to the use for
which the piece was made, were the watchwords for
Chippendale's most characteristic furniture. It is true
that during the early years of his work there was a
large demand for everything French, to which he
catered, yet he in time reversed this and caused the
attention of the world to be drawn to England as the
centre from which could be obtained the best designs in
furniture. While Chippendale sought for his effects
largely in his use of carving and gilding, although we
find little of this latter work in the pieces seen in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
America, he also took the greatest pains to select brilliant
and elegant brocades, wrought stuffs, and hand-worked
material for the upholstered parts of his furniture.
Nor did he neglect brass nails as a means of
brightening up a piece, though both Hepplewhite and
Sheraton used them more than he did. None of the
furniture which we so fondly ascribed to his name is
from the designs figured in his book, his use of brilliant
metal mounts is practically unknown among us. He
himself admired the beautiful Louis XIV ribbon ornament
which he lavished on so many chair backs, and he
says "If I may speak without vanity, they are the best
I have ever seen, or perhaps have ever been made."</p>

<p>Like his fellow-craftsmen, Chippendale made cases
for tall clocks, and some of them are odd and not in
the least graceful or beautiful. One will have for ornament
on the extreme top a crowing cock, life size, and
rampant, the base on which he stands being a mass of
ugly carving. Another has what might be called a
sunburst, with a star in its midst; others have allegorical
figures. His designs for mantel clocks were much
prettier and in better taste everyway. He used walnut
as well as mahogany for the cases, and sometimes Chinese
panels, or panels painted with nymphs and goddesses,
called in "French taste," were inserted. These
decorations served, besides, to ornament the fire-screens
which were popular pieces of furniture. He made
designs for chimney-pieces or "over-mantels." These
were filled in with glass. Chippendale says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Chimney-pieces require great care in the execution. The embossments
must be very bold, the foliage neatly laid down, and the
whole properly relieved. The top may be gilt, as likewise some
other ornamental parts."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>Knowing the sturdy, plain characteristics of Chippendale's
furniture as we see it, this constant reference
to gilt and the mass of over-decoration seems quite out
of place. His beds were called Canopy beds, Chinese
beds, Dome beds, Gothic beds with flat testers, Field
beds, Tent beds, Sofa beds with canopies, and the usual
high four-posters.</p>

<p>Many beautiful clothes-presses were made by Chippendale,
either chest like affairs on four legs, or having
drawers below and wardrobe above, some of these latter
bearing a strong resemblance to the French pieces
from which they were copied.</p>

<p>Scant mention is made of Chippendale, in contemporary
literature, but he has the distinction accorded
to but few of having a large class of furniture design
called by his name, instead of being designated by the
period in which it was made. Mr. Clouston, in his
book on "Chippendale Furniture" says that there
were two Chippendales, father and son, and alludes to
the author of the "Director" as "the elder Mr.
Chippendale". The son, like many sons of great men,
seems to have lost his identity in the reputation which
has been gradually gathering about his father's name.
He seems to have produced nothing of moment, and
the family has sunk again into the obscurity from
which one man had the genius to raise it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<small>ADAM, SHERATON, EMPIRE.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> increased market offered to English merchants
in the colonies, now more prosperous, produced in
quick succession several cabinet-makers who worked
in a different style from Chippendale, and made much
very handsome furniture. Robert and James Adam,
by training and profession architects, turned their
attention to furniture which would be appropriate in
rooms of Greek or Roman style. Their designs were
all on classic lines, and were beautifully painted besides
by the popular artists of the day, like Angelica
Kauffmann and Pergolese, who, like Alma Tadema in
our day, did not hesitate to expend their art upon
fine pieces of furniture.</p>

<p>The Adam brothers introduced the use of composition
ornaments coloured and gilded, which were really
a revival of the Italian process of "gesso," and which
they had learned during their years of study in Italy.
They designed many mantelpieces, also decorated in
classic style, and had a decided influence in moulding
the taste of their contemporaries and successors.
Satin-wood was introduced by them, or at least at
this period, and was used for inlaying as well as for the
manufacture of whole pieces of furniture. Most of it,
when used as the wood of the entire piece, is decorated
with medallions of marquetry of some darker
wood, as tulip, rosewood, or mahogany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>The Adam brothers did not make any furniture
themselves, but had it made by popular makers under
their personal direction. In <a href="#Page_76">Figure 29</a> are shown
three chairs of Adam design. The side chair retains
its original covering of a heavy wool plush, with classic
figures stamped in it of wreaths and maces. Its covering
was also designed by Adam. This chair and the
arm-chair like it are very delicately carved in low
relief with a small leaf pattern. The legs are fluted
and end in a form of spade-foot. The arm-chair on
the top is very richly carved, and the entire woodwork
is gilded. The covering has been restored. These
three chairs are in the Museum connected with Cooper
Institute.</p>

<p>In 1764 Robert Adam published his book dedicated
to George III., and illustrated with most elaborate
engravings by Bartolozzi and other fashionable engravers.
For this graceful act Robert Adam was appointed
architect to the king, and his rise was rapid and brilliant.
James Adam had now completed his studies
and was taken into partnership by his brother. In
1773 they began to publish engravings of their architectural
works in serial parts. They continued to
issue these until 1778, when the entire work was
published under the title of "Works in Architecture
by Robert and James Adam Esquires." It contains
quite as many designs for furniture as some of the so-called
furniture catalogues. While the outlines of the
furniture are very graceful and delicate, their beauty
is much increased by the skilful and artistic paintings
of Angelica Kauffmann and Zucchi by which they are
embellished. Pergolese was brought from Italy to
add still further to the beauty of their work. John
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Flaxman, at this time creating lovely classic designs
in various kinds of wares for Wedgwood, also contributed
to their success, and many of his plaques and
panels were set in their furniture to its further adornment.
They were used not only in satin-wood, but in
other furniture as well which was painted in the same
colours as the Wedgwood ware. Whole rooms, walls,
ceiling, and furniture were coloured to match, even
the harpsichord and candle-stands being painted and
decorated with Wedgwood plaques. Of the second
book, furniture designs fill one volume, mirrors another,
and girandoles a third.</p>

<p>Robert Adam showed wonderful skill and aptitude
in adapting classic forms to modern taste, and his
pieces are never overloaded with ornament, but retain
simple, graceful lines. He never considered any
detail too small for his minute attention. Besides
designing the woodwork of his furniture he also drew
the patterns for the stuffs to cover them; even the
little silk cushions on the arms of the chairs had the
same care bestowed on them as the backs and seat.
When he designed a bed, the counterpane to go on it
was also made under his direction or designed by him.
A little bag to hang on a lady's arm was not too
slight an object to be made beautiful by his artistic
hand. He paid the greatest attention to having the
covering for upholstered furniture appropriate to the
style of chair it went on, but he allowed himself great
latitude in gilding, and, as we have already said, in
painting his furniture in colours. He also gave variety
to his tables by the use of coloured marble tops.
The Adam brothers designed some of the interior
fittings for "Strawberry Hill." They also built Colzean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Castle, designed Alnwick Castle, and many other
splendid homes.</p>

<p>Thomas Shearer is a name not often heard in
America, yet the book, "The London Cabinet-Maker's
Book of Prices," published in 1788, contained many
beautiful designs by him. This work provided more
for the cabinet-maker himself than for the gentleman,
to whom most of the previous works of this nature
had been dedicated. There were many members of
the London Cabinet-Maker's Society, but only three
made the illustrations to the book,&mdash;Thomas Shearer,
Hepplewhite, and a man named Casement, who furnished
but two. Now, when there are so many banks
and safe-deposit companies, we do not feel the need of
secret drawers and repositories for storing our valuables.
They were quite necessary a hundred years
or more ago and much ingenuity was expended in
concealing them from curious or prying eyes. We
are also wont to consider recent times and conditions
responsible for such shams and mockeries as folding
beds, and articles of furniture that are not what they
seem. In these early books of designs are not only
folding beds, press-beds, and library bedsteads, but
folding washstands and toilet-tables, as well as tables,
toilets, and bureaus which concealed the mattress and
bed furniture by day.</p>

<p>Some of these pieces were most elaborate and had
intricate machinery to work them. A graceful, classical
urn of wood, touched on the right spot, would
open and disclose a basin and ewer, while a writing-table
could be unfolded into a lady's dressing-table
with folding glasses, and boxes for the necessary powder,
pomatum, brushes and pins.</p>

<p>To Thomas Shearer we are indebted for that useful
article, the sideboard, which has assumed such a
variety of forms, and among his designs were dressing,
card, and tea-tables, of many styles, and various desks,
but he designed no chairs. Many of his pieces bear a
close resemblance to those of Sheraton. Between
the severity of the latest period of Chippendale and
the dainty designs of Sheraton, Shearer and Hepplewhite
find their place, though neither of them ever
approached in beauty of design, or in popularity,
Chippendale who preceded them or Sheraton who
succeeded them.</p>

<p>A. Hepplewhite's book, "The Cabinet-Maker and
Upholsterer's Guide, or Repository of Designs for
Every Article of Household Furniture in the Newest
and Most Approved Taste," was published in 1789
and contained three hundred designs for pieces of
furniture which have been so often copied that they
have grown familiar to us. His chairs are extremely
pretty, but, unlike those of Chippendale, who sought
solidity and careful construction, Hepplewhite's chairs
were so faulty and fragile in construction that they
broke easily. Up to this time the splat had joined
the back of the chair and served to make it much
stronger, but Hepplewhite never brought it down to
the seat, usually having it curved and joining the side
rails three or four inches above the seat.</p>

<p>There are more pieces of Hepplewhite furniture in
America than one is aware of. His chairs are by no
means uncommon, and are very easily recognized by
their peculiar backs. His tables, with the delicate
inlay and slender tapering legs, as also his sideboards,
are frequently called by the name of his great successor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Sheraton, and even in England the two makers
are frequently confused. He had a specialty of his
own,&mdash;that of japanned or lacquered furniture, and the
patterns he most frequently employed were fruit and
flowers on a black ground. Paintings such as these
were taught to young ladies as an accomplishment at
school, and no doubt many of them tried their "prentice"
hands on some nice old mahogany piece as soon
as they got home.</p>

<p>Hepplewhite had another peculiarity in his preference
for using a circle or some portion of it in his
designs. On looking over his "Guide" one will
notice that a half circle was often used as the design
for a sideboard, or table to be set against the wall.
His small tables are nearly always round or a broad
oval, and his chair-backs follow the same shape, so did
his girandoles and tea-trays. For a central ornament
to his chair backs he frequently carved three Prince's
feathers, or drooping ears of wheat, neither of which
design is particularly pleasing. Besides the circular
he used also the shield-shaped back. In <a href="#Page_76">Figure 30</a>
are shown three of his characteristic chairs. The one
on the left has the Prince's feathers, and all of them
show the slender leg which in two of them ends in
the spade-foot.</p>

<p>The dining-tables of this period, before the days of
the extension table, had round, square, or octagonal
tops, supported on a column which rested on a plinth
having several carved feet. There were a number of
variations of the arrangement of feet. In order to
accommodate a large party several of these tables
could be placed together, and when not in use could
be placed against the wall to serve as side-tables. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
easy chairs&mdash;and he made many of these, large and
comfortable&mdash;he covered entirely with upholstery, no
woodwork showing but the legs. (See <a href="#Page_121">Figure 56)</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig031.jpg" alt="Figure 31. HEPPLEWHITE CARD-TABLE." width="397" height="600" />
<p class="caption">Figure 31. HEPPLEWHITE CARD-TABLE.</p>
</div>

<p>In the Hepplewhite and Shearer pieces the noticeable
feature of decoration is the inlay, often of two or
three coloured woods and in a variety of designs.
Many kinds of wood were employed at this time in
inlay or marquetry work, besides all the familiar ones
Shearer mentions,&mdash;"tulip, rose, snake, panella," etc.,
and later lilac-wood also was used. The husk pattern
was very popular at this period for an inlay pattern,
and Wedgwood also used it frequently in his splendid
jasper pottery. It resembles the husks of oats
when ripe, the spreading of the two halves allowing
the pattern to be used over and over again.</p>

<p>In Shearer's work, as well as Hepplewhite's, a slender
tapering leg is much in use, inlaid down about
half its length, often with satin-wood or holly, and
sometimes with ebony as well. Many of the sideboards
made in America were on English models, and
they are veneered on pine, the back and drawers being
made of this same wood. There are many variations
of shape,&mdash;what are known as serpentine and swell
fronts being quite usual, the handles being the oval
ones which are so common on all varieties of pieces
with drawers, and there is also a fan-shaped piece of
inlay which will frequently be seen. The position of this
is not always the same, it may be found in the corners
of closets, and long bottle-drawers, or it may be
inserted as a sort of brace between the bottom of the
sideboard and the legs. Hepplewhite was very fond
of inlaying a band of holly or satin-wood around the
legs of his pieces, three or four inches from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
ground. It will be found on his sideboards, card-tables
and desks, and is generally about an inch wide.
His book was one of the most valuable ever given to
English cabinet-makers. His individuality of shape
is always pleasing, even if he did not concern himself
about making his furniture structurally correct. He
claims, and indeed with absolute correctness, "to
unite elegance with utility and blend the useful with
the agreeable."</p>

<p>In <a href="#Page_79">Figure 31</a> is shown one of a pair of card-tables,
Hepplewhite design, made of mahogany and inlaid
with ebony and satin-wood. They belong to Mr. William
M. Hoyt of Rochester, N. Y.</p>

<p>Like Adam, Hepplewhite made great use of satin-wood
for whole pieces of furniture. He used his well-known
and characteristic shapes in chair-backs and
little sofas, cabinets and workstands, table stands, harpsichord
cases, and commodes. Satin-wood had been
but recently introduced from the East Indies and was
instantly popular. Even mantelpieces were made of
it, to match the furniture, and there was a fancy to
have the drawing-rooms and boudoirs very light and
elegant. Clothes had shrunk in dimensions, no more
hoops and farthingales embarrassed their wearers, the
stiffness was banished from coat-tails, and consequently
the furniture had shrunk too. Chairs were small and
narrow, and window-seats, made in abundance by Hepplewhite,
were deservedly popular, and the coverings
were in accord with the gaiety of the woodwork. Figure
32 shows two Hepplewhite settees with shield-shaped
backs. The upper one is of mahogany with
low relief carvings on the tops, and the lower of satin-wood,
with cane seat and the woodwork beautifully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
painted. The elegance of this painted satin-wood has
long been admired. Unfortunately it has caught the
popular taste, and it is now reproduced in such large
quantities that it is freely offered for sale by dealers in
our large cities. The pieces shown in our illustration
are both fine specimens of the original maker and are
owned by the Waring Galleries, London.</p>

</div>

<p>It was no longer necessary to make the legs of chairs
of such stout proportions, and as the bodies of the
chairs were lighter so the legs dwindled exceedingly
and were given only a semblance of solidity by the
use of the "spade-foot" so much affected by Hepplewhite.
Their appearance of fragility was farther
enhanced by groovings and flutings, but they are
always pretty.</p>

<p>Although his characteristic chairs have shield-shaped
or oval backs, he gives in his book eighteen designs of
bannister-backed chairs, to be carried out in mahogany.
The general dimensions given by Hepplewhite for his
chairs are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Width in front, 20 inches; depth of seat, 17 inches; height of
seat frame, 17 inches; total height, about 37 inches."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He gives most definite directions about coverings.
Mahogany chairs should have the seats of horsehair,
plain, striped, checkered, etc., according to taste; or
cane bottoms with cushions which should be covered
with the same material as the bed and window curtains.
He was fond of the "Duchess," which consisted of two
Barjeer or arm-chairs with a stool between them, all
three pieces fitting together at pleasure and making a
lounge from six to eight feet long. His press-beds
vary little in appearance from wardrobes, but it was in
smaller and daintier pieces that his particular talent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
found play. His knife-boxes are extremely elegant,
particularly when in urn shape with a rod in the centre
to prevent the top of the urn from being removed.
All the handles and knobs on his larger pieces of furniture
are round, but on sideboards frequently oval, his
double chests of drawers have either French or block
feet.</p>

<p>Tripod reading-desks, urn-stands, beautiful tea-trays,
caddies and tea-chests are richly inlaid or painted. We
find him not only making very ornate and richly
inlaid card-tables, but "Pembroke tables" as well, with
either round or square tops. Such tables have leaves,
but, instead of the legs moving out to support the
leaves, small arms come out from the table-frame.</p>

<p>His writing-tables and desks have tambour tops, that
is strips of wood pasted on cloth, so that they roll back
into receptacles provided for them, and are filled with
secret drawers and flat cupboards for deeds or papers.
Among his other small pieces which are distinguished
by their grace are dressing-glasses, shaving-tables with
glasses and without, "bason" stands, designs for brackets,
fire-screens, wash-hand-stands, cornices, lamps, girandoles,
and looking-glasses. His larger designs show
dressing-tables and bureaus with curved and swell
fronts, beds, four-posters, and field-beds with very
graceful sweeps and much variety of design. His
stuffed furniture is comfortable in the extreme, and
the tall easy chairs with cheek pieces must have been
well calculated to protect from searching draughts.
Many of these easy chairs found their way to America,
and as their cost was not extortionate moderate homes
enjoyed them as well as wealthy ones.</p>

<p>After the Revolution, in all the seaboard towns and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the more settled places near cities, there was a still
greater call for all styles and luxuries popular in England.
Indeed the former Colonies presented very
curious and marked contrasts, being, as it is tersely
put, "rolling in wealth or dirt poor." In Philadelphia
there had been much style and "gentility" for many
years. The English officers had, no doubt, brought
some comforts with them, and they found others awaiting
them. Major Andrés letter describing supper at
the "Mischianza," May 18, 1778, gives a vivid picture
of the festivities of the times.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"At twelve, supper was announced, and the large folding-doors
being suddenly thrown open discovered a magnificent salon of 210
feet long by 40 feet wide, and 22 in height, with three alcoves on
each side which served for sideboards. Fifty-six large pier-glasses
ornamented with green silk artificial flowers and ribbands; one
hundred branches with three lights in each trimmed in the same
manner as the mirrors; eighteen lustres each with twenty-four
lights suspended from the ceiling and ornamented as the
branches.</p>

<p>Three hundred wax tapers disposed along the supper-tables,
four hundred and thirty covers, twelve hundred dishes, twenty-four
black slaves in Oriental dresses with silver-collars and bracelets
ranged in two lines, and bending to the ground as the General
Howe and the Admiral appeared together."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All the lustres, mirrors, etc., with which the room was
adorned, were borrowed, says Watson, from the townsfolk,
and all were returned uninjured.</p>

<p>Eighty-four families kept carriages in 1772, and
writing as late as 1802, Dr. Michaud calls Philadelphia&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"At present the largest, the handsomest, and the most populous
city of the United States. The streets are paved, and are provided
with broad bricked footways. Pumps, placed on each side
of them at about one hundred yards from each other, supply an
abundance of water."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>Dolly Madison, writing in 1791 of the fashions of
the day in Philadelphia, says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Very long trains are worn, and they are festooned up with
loops and bobbin and small covered buttons, the same as the dress.
The hats are quite a different shape from what they used to be.
The bonnets are all open on the top, through which the hair is
passed, either up or down as you fancy, though latterly they wear
it more up than down; it is quite out of fashion to frizz or curl
the hair."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Salem, in Massachusetts, with her vessels touching
at every port, was already becoming known for her
luxury, her teak-wood as well as her mahogany furniture,
her china and plate. Enough of these still
remain to show her importance and the elegance of her
homes. But there was another side to this picture.
Here is the description of the home of a settler away
from any of the large centres, Charles Rich, of Vermont,
member of Congress, began housekeeping as
late as 1791. All his household possessions were
valued at $66.00. He writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I constructed at the mill a number of household articles of furniture
which have been in daily use from that time to the present."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The newest styles were of small importance in such
surroundings as these, and luxuries passed slowly
along pioneer roads; yet every ship coming to American
ports brought furniture, stuffs, plate, and china to
tempt the wealth of those who could afford them, and
among such were pieces made by Sheraton, the
fashionable cabinet-maker who came on the scene late
enough to profit by the designs of his predecessors.
Indeed he is most frankly pleased with his own skill
and artistic taste, and in his long preface sets forth
the merits of his own book and discredits all those
before him. He considers his book much superior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
because he gives drawings in perspective. Much of
the book is a very dry dissertation on geometry. Its
second half gives descriptions of furniture, of the
various styles, and the uses of the pieces. He says in
his Introduction:</p>

</div>

<blockquote>
<p>"The design of this part of the Book is intended to exhibit the
present taste of furniture, and at the same time give the workman
some assistance in the manufacturing part of it."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sheraton's early furniture is distinguished by great
elegance of design, fine construction, and graceful
ornament. (See <a href="#Page_81">Figure 33</a>.) The legs of his pieces
are slender and straight, as distinguished from the
cabriole leg, but are generally enriched with flutings,
and they taper pleasingly to the foot. While he uses
carving, it is generally applied in low relief and does
not interfere with the lines of construction. His
preference is, like Hepplewhite's, for ornamenting with
inlay of woods of different colours and decorating with
brass. The fine proportions of his early furniture, the
simple shapes clearly defined, and its structural beauty
where each part is doing its work, render it admirable
in every way.</p>

<p>A simple desk of Sheraton pattern is given in
<a href="#Page_83">Figure 34</a>. It is of mahogany, and the doors of the
upper part open, revealing pigeon-holes and drawers.
The flat top over the drawers opens out on rests, making
a broad, flat desk top. The brasses and key-scutcheons
are original, and the moulding of the
drawers overlaps.</p>

<p>After 1793 Sheraton made little furniture, but gave
his time chiefly to writing his furniture books. For
the patterns used in his inlay he had recourse to classic
models for his inspiration, like the Adam brothers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
who had done much to popularize this simplicity of
design. Sheraton used urns, rosettes, festoons, scrolls,
and pendant flowers as his favorite decorations. The
simple curves of which many of these are composed
lent themselves admirably to inlay, and the harmony
of the colours of the woods gave a grace to this form
of ornament and suits it exactly to the furniture on
which it finds a place.</p>

<p>Sheraton wrote several works on furniture and
upholstery. The first one published in 1791, was
"The Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer's Drawing
Book." This was followed by "Designs for Household
Furniture" in 1804, and he had not completed
his "Cabinet-Maker, Upholsterer, and General Artist's
Encyclopedia" in 1807. He gave directions for
making, among other things, folding-beds, washstands,
card-tables, sideboards, and many other pieces. He
frequently employed the lyre as a design for his chair-backs,
as well as supports for tables. In chairs it often
has strings of brass; on the tables it takes heavier
and more substantial form.</p>

<p>Sheraton's beds seem almost as impossible as Chippendale's.
He, too, made alcove, sofa, or couch beds.
He also gave designs for "summer beds" made in two
compartments (we should call them "twin beds,") but
both are included under a frame or canopy, and the
whole affair is very cumbersome and heavy. His
chairs, tables, and sideboards are the pieces by which
we know him best and in which he is most admirable.
He says himself, in regard to drawing-room chairs,
that many are finished in white and gold, or that the
ornaments may be japanned, but that the French finish
them in mahogany with gilt mouldings. Sheraton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
made very dainty designs for tripod stands, fire-screens
and ladies' desks, with tambour doors. Also
"bason"-stands with tambour doors and writing-desks
with curved cylinder tops, which tops fell into the
space behind the pigeon-holes and drawers. Wash-hand
tables had also these curved cylinder tops, and
all furniture which was put to toilet purposes was so
arranged that it would look like something else, and
transform a bedroom into a boudoir. These cylinder-topped
pieces were designed as early as 1792.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Figure 37. SHERATON SIDEBOARD.</p>
</div>

<p>In furniture, as in art, there are no absolutely abrupt
changes, but one style is overshadowed by another as
Chippendale gradually overcame the rococo and stood
for an individual style. Hepplewhite influenced
Sheraton very much, although the latter declares in
one of his books, published two years later than Hepplewhite's,
that the latter's designs have become quite
antiquated. Such a piece of furniture is seen in the
sideboard-table or sideboard given in <a href="#Page_85">Figure 35</a>. It
was undoubtedly made by one of these two men, and
it is difficult to decide which. The form of foot is
more common to Hepplewhite than to Sheraton, and
the inlaid border of satin-wood is wider than he was
wont to use. The brass rail at the back was used to
support silver or porcelain dishes. The handles are
original and the wood mahogany. This handsome
piece belongs to the Waring Galleries, London.</p>

<p>Horsehair was used for covering by both makers, and
in both cases gilt-headed nails put in a festoon were
used to fasten it down. Sheraton's first style was
much the most pleasing. It was distinguished by a
delicacy and an elegance which were entirely lost in his
later designs, which were so strongly influenced by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Empire style. The first illustration in his "Cabinet
Maker's and Upholsterer's Book" is what he calls a
"Universal table," to be made of mahogany, and which
at will may be converted into a dining-table, or, by
pulling out a drawer, discover all the compartments
necessary for storing kitchen condiments, such as sugar
and spices, etc. The sofa depicted in <a href="#Page_85">Figure 36</a> shows
this merging into Empire style, for the legs are heavier
than those we are accustomed to, and the carved
pineapple appears on the arm instead of the more delicate
carving seen on earlier chairs and sofas. The
covering is hair-cloth fastened down with brass nails.
This sofa stood for many years in the Old Manse at
Concord, Mass. It belonged to the Rev. Ezra Ripley,
who came to Concord as pastor in 1778. Times were
unsettled and currency was depreciated, so that when
his salary of five hundred and fifty pounds was paid it
was found to be worth just forty pounds. To make
up this deficiency Dr. Ripley did a man's work in the
fields. For years he laboured at tilling the ground at
least three days in a week and sometimes even more.
He was an ardent man, and from his moral worth was
often known as "Holy Ripley." This sofa, uneasy
as it looks to modern eyes, perhaps seemed luxurious
to him after a day at the plough. The cover which it
wears is said to be the original one, and if this is true
its condition is so good that I fear the sofa was kept
permanently in the "south parlor" or the "north parlor,"
as the best room was called in those days, and
the good man was given nothing easier to rest on than
a wooden Windsor chair, or a straight-backed rush-bottomed
one, or perhaps the kitchen settle.</p>

</div>

<p>With the introduction and extended use of the sideboard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
came several articles to be used in connection
with it, to which Sheraton turned his attention.
Among these may be mentioned knife and spoon-boxes,
which were of several different designs. Sheraton
apparently did not make these knife-boxes himself,
but only designed them, for he says,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"As these cases are not made in regular cabinet shops it may be
of service to mention where they may be executed in the best
taste by one who makes it his main business, i. e. John Lane, No.
44, St. Martin's-le-Grand, London."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two pretty ones, as well as two wine-coolers, are shown
on the sideboard in <a href="#Page_87">Figure 37</a>. This sideboard has
two little closets with tambour doors at the bottom,
and deep wine-drawers on the sides. There is the brass
rail similar to the one in <a href="#Page_85">Figure 35</a>. This piece belongs
to the Waring Galleries, London.</p>

<p>One of the handsomest knife-boxes is an urn-shaped
one which has been noted as made also by Hepplewhite.
It is wrought in mahogany, the veneer made
in pie-shaped pieces, each bit being outlined with a delicate
line of hollywood. The knives were held in a
perforated rack inside, with the handles up, and a pair
of these boxes on either end of the sideboard made a
very ornamental finish. Another shape also in vogue
was more box-like in shape, the cover sloping toward
the front. Not only knives, but spoons also, were held
in the racks with which the interior was fitted; and
as these latter were put in bowls up, the cases, when
open, showed to excellent advantage the worldly wealth
of the household, and were ornamental besides. Sometimes
the covers of these boxes set back flat against a
portion of the top, and made a tray on which could be
placed silver cups, mugs, posset-pots, ewers, or any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
pieces of table silver of moderate size. Then there
were the wine-boxes, or wine-coolers as they were often
called, handsome massive boxes of wood, generally
mahogany, or whatever wood the sideboard was made
of. They stood beneath it, or, if the sideboard was
low, at one side. The usual number of bottles they
contained was from four to a dozen. General Washington's
wine-box has room for eighteen bottles.
There are still a dozen of the original bottles in it,
holding a gallon each. We should call them decanters,
for they are of handsome cut glass.</p>

<p>There is a letter from General Washington to Colonel
Hamilton in the possession of Major Church of
Rochester, N. Y., presenting him with a wine-cooler,
"holding six bottles ... one of four which I
imported during my term of governmental administration."</p>

<p>A more usual style of sideboard, Sheraton pattern,
is that given in <a href="#Page_88">Figure 38</a>. This handsome and useful
piece of furniture had its counterparts in many of the
stately old houses from the Carolinas up. It is of the
swell-front type and has five deep drawers and a closet.
The wood is mahogany and without inlay. This
sideboard is at the Whipple House, Ipswich, Mass.</p>

<p>After the French Revolution of 1790 furniture became
markedly different. Greek models were chosen
once more; the tripod became a favorite support.
Mahogany was freely used, but so were coarse woods,
in which case they were carved and profusely gilded.
The most valuable book, for cabinet-makers, on "Empire"
furniture, was published by the architects Percier
and Fontaine in 1809. It was not filled with
fanciful designs merely, as we have seen was the case
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
with some of the catalogues of English makers, but
every design shown in it had been carried out before
it was published. Many of the drawings were adapted
from classic models preserved in the Vatican. In
many ways this style has not much to recommend it.
It is apt to be heavy and stiff, particularly when made
by English makers. The French decorated it with
exquisite forms in metal (treated in another chapter),
but the English contented themselves with cast brass.
It was far preferable under the manipulation of American
cabinet-makers, who restricted the use of brass
and allowed the handsome woods to show themselves
to the best advantage. The Dutch, who also were
not behind hand in the adoption of this and Napoleonic
style, made tables, secretaries, chairs, etc., severe and
regular in form, but enriched with their admirable
marquetry, and with heads and feet of animals sparingly
used. Sheraton and Shearer were swept along
by the tide of fashion and drew Empire designs.</p>

<p>Gillow, the inventor of the extension-table, whose
firm was established as early as 1800, made many fine
designs and had orders from the best patrons. His
firm is still carried on under the same name.</p>

<p>In 1808 George Smith was made "Upholder Extraordinary
to H. R. H., the Prince of Wales." He published
a book, of course, having a hundred and fifty-eight
designs. They included bedsteads, tables, chairs,
bookcases and commodes, and other articles of furniture
copied from the French, like escritoires, jardinières,
chiffonièrs, showing how the fancy for French things
was increasing. He gives very definite rules as to
how and when to use various woods.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"Mahogany, when used in houses of consequence, should be
confined to the parlour and bed-chamber floors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In furniture for these apartments the less inlay of other woods,
the more chaste will be the style of work. If the wood be of a
fine compact and bright quality, the ornaments may be carved
clean in the mahogany. Where it may be requisite to make out
panelling by inlay of lines, let these be of brass or ebony.</p>

<p>"In drawing-rooms, boudoirs, ante-rooms, East and West
India satin-wood, rosewood, tulip-wood, and the other varieties of
woods brought from the East, may be used. With satin and
light-coloured woods the decorations may be of ebony or rosewood;
with rosewood let the decorations be ormolu and the inlay
of brass."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#Page_90">Figure 39</a> shows a handsome sofa of carved mahogany,
Empire style, before it had arrived at its heaviest
stage. The carving is extremely handsome, both
rails of seat and back being decorated with dolphins.
The foot is of the bear shape, and the arms are graceful
in curve. This piece is of English make.</p>

<p>While we miss in the late Empire styles&mdash;say from
1810 to 1825&mdash;much of the lightness and grace which
had been contributed by the carving and inlay which
were so freely used in the preceding period, yet there
was a solidity and massive dignity which was not
without a certain charm. Then, too, these pieces were
generally veneered, and in them the beautiful grain of
the mahogany, which was the favorite wood, showed
to greatest advantage. The sofa in <a href="#Page_90">Figure 40</a> is
such a piece. It is of unusual length, the top of the
arm is stuffed, thus doing away with "squabs," as the
cushions which were used on sofas, long and narrow,
were called.</p>

<p>The wood, which is largely shown, is of that dark
rich hue inclined to red, with veining many shades
darker, and it is in a fine state of preservation. This
piece belongs to Anthony Killgore, Esq., Flemington,
N. J.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>To about the same period does the pier-table belong
(<a href="#Page_92">Figure 41</a>), which is not usual in design, because of
the third pier which starts from a circular shelf in the
middle of the base. The swan piers at each end are
very graceful, and the handsome grain of the mahogany
is shown to great advantage. This piece belongs
to the Misses Killgore, of Flemington, N. J., as does
the sideboard shown in <a href="#Page_92">Figure 42</a>. The doors of the
lower part, with the fan, are solid mahogany, the
carving on the legs and ornamental scrolls is fine. The
middle of the top is raised to permit the insertion of a
looking-glass, and the capitals at the tops of the pillars
are of fine brass-work. Above the middle drawer,
a shelf draws out for use in serving meals. The whole
sideboard sets back on a little shelf above the bear's
feet, a feature not unusual in the finer boards of this
period.</p>

<p>The surroundings of this fine old piece of furniture
are in keeping with its importance, the china showing
above it on the wall being the Staffordshire blue
made during the first quarter of the nineteenth century,
while the mirror directly above it is of equal age.</p>

<p>Environment has a great deal to do with bringing
out the true beauties of this stately old furniture. It
must be surrounded with objects of approximate age
and of equal dignity, otherwise it looks as unseemly as
an ancient dame with a pink rose in her hair. The
work-table shown in <a href="#Page_84">Figure 43</a> belongs to the same
period, but of a little earlier date than the last pieces
shown. The legs are richly carved, as is the central
pillar. This also belongs to the Misses Killgore.</p>

<p>Not many pieces of such solidity were required
in a room, and in those days overloading did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
stand for elegance. In 1800, when the spacious
Tayloe house in Washington was built, the furniture
of the great drawing-room was a set of ash, sixteen
pieces. There were twelve chairs with chintz cushions,
and two card-tables; there were also a centre table
and one upholstered couch, and a settee, but not one
so-called easy-chair. Much furniture like that shown
in Figures 40-43, is to be found in the old houses of
such places as Cherry Valley, N. Y., where there is
little changing about, and furniture has descended
from one generation to another and still stands in its
old familiar home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>COLONIAL AND LATER PERIODS.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Under</span> the broad head of Colonial Furniture may
really be classed all the "movables and chattels"
which belonged to the early settlers, while to be
entirely correct, this characterization belongs only to
such furniture as was brought in or made before 1776.
As the pioneers came from many lands, so many different
kinds of furniture will be included in the list.</p>

<p>We must begin at the South, with the melancholy
little plantation at Jamestown. Through evil times
the feeble colony struggled, harassed by poverty,
disease, savage foes, and internal dissensions. There
in 1607 were planted the first beginnings of the
settlements which were in three hundred years to cover
a continent. Traces of the little colony have almost
disappeared now by the action of the James River,
high tide covering the brick foundations of the ancient
buildings. Walking along the shore one may find
little red and white clay pipes, in smoking which,
filled with the fragrant weed, the pioneers forgot their
woes. Glass beads striped like gooseberries, to take
the eyes of the Indians in barter, pieces of water-soaked
brick from these toil-built houses, and even
traces of the days of Smith, sword-hilts, bits of armour,
balls, etc., and&mdash;more pathetic mementos of Jamestown's
trials&mdash;human bones and coffin-handles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet in 1639, thirty-two years after the foundation
of the colony, there were in Maryland some planters
called "rich," who measured their worldly goods by
their value in tobacco, the raising of which weed had
proved their only salvation. The laws regarding its
cultivation, particularly in Massachusetts, were very
stringent. It was only to be grown as medicine and
used privately. It was considered a more harmful
indulgence than liquor, and the "Creature called
Tobacko" was hemmed and hedged about with rules
and restrictions. It circumvented them all, was
planted and grown, and finally became a commodity
of much value and a medium of exchange. About
ninety years later we find an item which shows how
universal had become its use. The will of May Bickley,
attorney general of the province of New York,
filed April 27, 1724, directs that he "wishes to be
buried without pipes and tobacco as is usual."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig044.jpg" alt="Figure 44. KITCHEN AT DEERFIELD, MASS." width="600" height="363" />
<p class="caption">Figure 44. KITCHEN AT DEERFIELD, MASS.</p>
</div>

<p>To Maryland and Virginia were transplanted almost
bodily rich homes from the mother country, filled
with the luxuries to which their occupants had been
accustomed. It has been said that many of the grand
old homes in the South were built of "English brick."
While this is true in the letter, it is entirely misleading
to the reader in general. The bricks were not
brought from England, because at that time there
were few ships afloat capable of bearing any such
quantity as would have been necessary for a house of
any considerable size. Mr. McCrady, in his "History
of South Carolina," has taken considerable pains to
explain how this error arose. The historic Miles
Brewton house, now called the Pringle house built
about 1770 in the city of Charleston, is one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
best known houses in the State. It was used as
military headquarters during both the Revolutionary
and the Civil wars. It has been computed, by actual
measurement, that the house contains 1,278,720 bricks.
Each of these weighs eight pounds, the whole amounting
to 4,566 tons. No vessels then afloat could carry
more than 500 tons, so it would have taken nine of
such vessels to bring over the bricks for this house
alone. Josiah Quincy says in his Journal that this
house cost about $50,000, which sum would hardly
have covered the expense of so many vessels from
London. Mr. McCrady's solution is that there were
two styles of brick made, one, large and heavy, known
as "English" the other called "Dutch" which were
very small.</p>

<p>There were, however, bricks brought from England,
for the prices of brick, both of British and New
England make, were fixed by statute. As early as
1662 brickmakers and bricklayers were paid by each
thousand bricks made and laid by them. The first
material brought into Virginia for building purposes
was in 1607, for the use of George Percy. Brickmakers
were twice advertised for in 1610, and joiners were
at work on the furniture needed for the new homes.</p>

<p>The houses late in the seventeenth century were
by no means so large as one would expect. Six or
eight rooms was the usual size, and many had even
fewer. The house of Cornelius Lloyd, whose estate
was valued at 131,044 pounds of tobacco, contained a
chamber and hall and a kitchen with loft and dairy.
The windows were often but sliding panels, but in
houses of any pretensions glass was used. In 1684
Colonel Byrd sent to London for 400 feet of glass,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
with drawn lead and solder in proportion. Robert
Beverly, Sr., one of the richest men in the Virginia
colony prior to the opening of the eighteenth century,
had in his dining-hall one oval and one folding table,
a leather couch, two chests, a chest of drawers and
fifteen Russia-leather chairs, value £9 9<i>s.</i> His supply
of table linen was abundant, and the table-ware was
pewter, with wooden trenchers and some earthenware.
Richard Hobbs, of Rappahannock, who died in 1667,
owned, among much household stuff, but a single
fork, John Frison, of Henrico County had one of
tortoise-shell. Robert Dudley, of Middlesex County
who died in 1700, had several forks made of horn.</p>

<p>To show some of the luxuries for sale in Virginia
prior to 1670 the inventory of the store of John
Frison, mentioned above, is given.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Holland night-caps; muslin neck-cloths; silk-fringed gloves;
silver shoe-buckles; embroidered Holland waistcoats; 2 doz. pr.
white gloves; 1 lace cap; 7 lace shirts; 9 lace ruffles; holster-caps
of scarlet embroidered with silver and gold; gold and silver
hat-bands; a parcel of silver lace; and a feathered velvet cap."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were also many valuable furs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Diggs, widow of the governor of Virginia,
died in 1699. She was a person of much consequence
in the colony, and her inventory is interesting on
that account. In her hall parlour were&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"5 Spanish tables; 2 green and two Turkey-worked carpets;
9 Turkey-worked chairs, and 11 with arrows woven on the seats;
1 embroidered and 1 Turkey-worked couch; 5 pictures (valued
at five shillings); 2 pairs of brass andirons; 3 pr. old tongs; and
1 clock."</p>

<p>Not only did English ships bring on every voyage
the best that England afforded, but Dutch traders,
too, crowded in with their own goods, and others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
besides from the East. The inventories mention
"Dutch cases", and "Dutch turned chairs", before
1680; and as these rich planters had tobacco to trade,
they obtained all the luxuries to be had. It is seen
that New England had her rich and prosperous men
also, and some fine homes were built as early as 1639.
<a href="#Page_75">Figure 27</a>, shows a room in the famous
old Whipple House, Ipswich, Mass., built about 1642.
The solidity of these houses is exemplified by the
beams, with their finely moulded edges. The
furniture is both interesting and beautiful, one
of the most attractive pieces being the desk made on
Sheraton lines which stands on the right-hand side.
A handsome bookcase and desk fill the corner, and
a little Pembroke table holds much glass.</p>

<p>The picture (<a href="#Page_96">Figure 44</a>) shows a
typical New England kitchen in Colonial times. It
has been arranged in the Deerfield Memorial Hall, and
all the furniture and utensils shown herein were
gathered in the neighbourhood. These primitive
homes did not have mantelpieces as a rule, but the
heavy wooden beam fashioned with an axe was called
the mantel-tree. The one shown here did duty for
a hundred and sixty-eight years. The wide chimney-piece
could easily accomodate the small children of
the family sitting on billets of wood, while the elders
were comfortable on the settle with its high backboard.
It has a convenient candle-bracket which
could be adjusted to suit the reader, and if more
light were needed the candle-stand was convenient.
The back of this settle is sixty inches high, more than
is usual. It was owned by Jacob Rich, who settled
in the neighbourhood of Deerfield, Mass., in 1777.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>A famous house was known as the "Old Stone
House" at Guilford, Conn., while at Boston, Salem,
Danvers, Dedham, and Dorchester was built many a
sturdy dwelling still standing to show with what
solidity these pioneers did their work. In the earliest
days of the Colony's struggles too much luxury was
not deemed good for those battling with the wilderness.
Governor Winthrop writes with some gratification
in 1630 of the burning up of some fine table
linen, brought by a "godly woman of the Church of
Boston" from London, and of which she was very
proud.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"But it pleased God that the loss of this linen did her much
good, both in taking off her heart from worldly comforts, and in
preparing her for a far greater affliction by the untimely death
of her husband, who was slain not long after at Isle of Providence."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet in 1647, when he married the widow Coytemore,
he seems to have had no hesitation in accepting with
her a rich dowry, her share of the estate of her former
husband, and valued at £640 1<i>s</i> 8<i>d</i>. Among the items
were such frivolities as "a silver girdle and a silk
iacket." There must have been also other choice
garments in the many chests and trunks enumerated.
One of these chests is specified as "spruce." The
widow had a brave stock of pewter, worth £135, and
among other goods unusual at this period were,</p>

<table summary="list">
<tr><td>"1 chest of drawers £1<br /></td></tr>
<tr><td>a copp. furnace £1 10<i>s.</i><br /></td></tr>
<tr><td>A parcel of cheney platters and soucers £1<br /></td></tr>
<tr><td>2 flaskets<br /></td></tr>
<tr><td>A bedstead, trundle bed with ropes and mats."</td></tr>

<p class="caption">Figure 46. RUSH-BOTTOMED CHAIRS.</p>
</div>

<p>It is a matter of wonder how the governor reconciled
his conscience to the silver girdle and "iacket,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
for in 1634 the Massachusetts General Court had particularly
prohibited the wearing of either "gold or
silver girdles, hattbands, belts, ruffs, and beaver hatts."
Also they forbade the purchase of "any appell, either
wollen, silke, or lynnen with any lace on it, silver
golde, silke or threed." They were only allowed one
"slash" on each sleeve and one on the back. These
rules were operative for many years, for in Salem, in
1653, a man is haled before the court for excess "in
bootes, rebonds, gould, and silver lace." In Newbury,
Mass., in 1653, two women were brought before
the court for wearing "a silk hood and scarfe," but
both were discharged for proving their husbands were
worth over £100. John Hutchin's wife was also discharged
"upon testimony of her being brought up
above the ordinary ranke." These items show that
both rank and property were saving grace even among
the Puritans, and no doubt Mrs. Winthrop escaped
censure under this rule.</p>

<p>Boston, about 1650, had houses partly of brick and
partly of stone, as well as plainer wooden ones. In
1640 John Davys built for William Rix, a weaver, a
house "16 feet long and 14 feet wide, with a chamber
floare finished with summer and ioysts." There was
also a cellar, the walls were covered with clapboards,
and the chimney was made of hewn timber, daubed.
The whole house cost £21. This was a typical house
of a workingman, and must have required little furniture
besides the loom to fill it. The fine houses with
ample halls and large rooms were but the forerunners
of that comfortable style we call by the name Colonial.
But they were precious things when once built,
and it is by no means uncommon to find them parcelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
out to different relatives. In 1658 John Greene
of Warwick, R. I., gives to his beloved wife&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"a large hall and chimni with a little chamber adjoining to the
hall, as also a large chamber with a little chamber within y<sup>t</sup>, with
a large garret and with a little dary room which buttes against ye
oule house during her life; also half ye orchard."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems as if this bequest might have been open to
different interpretations among the heirs. He does
not specify if he left the "goods" which were in the
hall and rooms,&mdash;quite important items.</p>

<p>The widow Francis Killburn's house at Hartford,
whose estate in 1650 was valued at £349, had in her
hall "tables, formes, chaires, stools, and benches," all
valued at £1.</p>

<p>Mr. Palfrey says in his "History of New England"
that Whitfield's house at Guilford, Mass., built in
1639, is the oldest house standing now in New England.
There were three stone houses built at Guilford
this same year, and it is now asserted that there
are quite a number of houses still standing which were
built before that of Whitfield. The Barker house at
Pembroke, Mass., built in 1628, is said to be the most
ancient. The walls of the Whitfield house are of
stone; it is two stories high with garret, and the timber
is oak. There are two secret closets which were
found by removing a board in the attic. This house
was ample and commodious, and the household furnishings
were of corresponding value.</p>

<p>In the colonies during the seventeenth century the
doublet was worn by women as well as by men. Men
wore it over a sleeved waistcoat. The sleeves were
elaborately slashed and embroidered. There were
falling bands at the neck for those who wished, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the sedately inclined wore white linen collars. Trunk
hose were used, and shoes plainly tied or with
rosettes. A beaver or felt hat was a necessary
adjunct, and all those who could afford it wore gloves,
embroidered if possible. These gloves had gauntlets,
worked or fringed, and such an important item of
dress were the gloves that in 1645 the glovers petitioned
the Council to prevent the export of undressed
goat-skins.</p>

<p>In many inventories the item of leather breeches
appears, and in connection with them the comment
"half wore out." Henry Webb, of Boston, who died
in 1660, left an estate much of which descended to
Harvard College. His wearing-apparel was unusually
limited for a man of means. In women's inventories
the most important item is always linen or plate, a
"ring with a diamond" valued at eight shillings being
an unusual piece of luxury belonging to Mistress Anne
Hibbins in 1656.</p>

<p>The best articles which New England exported, and
for which England was most greedy, were masts,
thirty-three to thirty-five inches in diameter, selling for
from £95 to £115 each. These and salt fish proved of
more value to the colonies than any other commodity
possessed at that time.</p>

<p>Much of the furniture of the old homes has disappeared.
Some is still retained by the descendants
of its original owners, and there are other pieces now
gathered in museums, nearly every city endeavouring to
retain the mementos of her early history.</p>

<p>By 1700 Philadelphia was quite a flourishing town.
The life of the country magnates was elegant and
dignified. Many rich men had both town and country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
houses complete in every detail. Before the Pennsylvania
Colony was five years old, (the grant was
given March 24, 1681) William Penn had set the
example of having a town and country house, the
latter being completed in 1685. He owned a coach
and a calash, and had, besides, a fine barge with oars-men
who rowed him between his house and Philadelphia.
Fairfield, the home of the Norris family, was
finished in 1717, and was at that time the most beautiful
home in Philadelphia. The sashes for the windows
and most of the interior woodwork was imported
from England, as was the furniture. The hall was
considered wonderfully elegant, being paved with marble.
There were substantial houses of brick, the
latter of which were home-made, and many artizans of
all trades, Dutch as well as English, were coming
over. William Penn wrote to his agent of such a one,
and said that he was to be set to work making wainscot
and tables and chairs, as Penn himself was to
bring much furniture with him. His house in Bucks
County was of brick, two stories and a half high, and
was comfortably filled with furniture, some, as we see,
made before he arrived, but most of which he brought
with him. There was much silver plate, pewter
dishes, cisterns, etc., beds, tables, stands and chairs.
In the best parlour were two tables, one great cane
chair, four small cane chairs, one couch, and many
cushions of divers materials. The great hall where
they dined had "one long table, two forms, and six
chairs." The dining-room was a later development, and
not until the eighteenth century was well advanced do
we find rooms so called in even the better class of houses.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_98">Figure 45</a> shows an oak table, of what is called the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
thousand-legged pattern. It belongs to Mrs. B. H.
Oliver, of Chester, Pa., and has an interesting history.
It is circular in shape, five feet in diameter, and is in
good order. It is said to be part of the furniture
brought to America by William Penn, from whom it
descended to the Bradfords, a well-known Philadelphia
family of printers. It was given by them to a
young clerk in their office, named McGowan. In
1849 it came into the possession of Mrs. Oliver's
father, and when he died he bequeathed it to his son,
Dr. John Hepburn, of Warren, Pa., who gave it to his

<p>This style of table dates to the first half of the
seventeenth century, as may be seen by the drawer
which all these early tables had. The brass handle is
a late addition, and the drawer has about it the overlapping
edge, this style immediately succeeding the
drawers with mouldings like those shown in the chest
on frame in <a href="#Page_13">Figure 5</a>. The legs fold together, fitting
into the lower braces, and the leaves drop. This make
of table was always considered of value, so we find
them selling at Philadelphia in 1705 at £2; at Boston,
1699, at £2; in 1690 at Salem, "a round, black walnut
table, £2 5<i>s</i>." Such a table as this was used by Sir
William Johnson, so potent a factor in the settlement
of the Mohawk Valley. His table is of mahogany,
the leaves drop on hinges, and it has one more leg on
each side than our example. It is oval in shape
instead of round, six feet six inches long, and five feet
eleven inches in its shortest diameter. In 1776 this
table was confiscated, and was bought by the Hon.
John Taylor. His descendents have lent it to the
Albany Historical Society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>The social life in Philadelphia in Revolutionary
times was easy and agreeable, consisting of the original
Quaker families and another class connected with
the government, and these two gave the tone to
society. The pleasures of the table were the only
luxuries which the sedate Quakers allowed themselves,
and the city was famous for the quality of its Madeira
and French wines, and the wonderful cooking of West
India turtle. In 1778 differences in rank were strongly
marked. The labourer wore his leather breeches,
checkered shirt, and neat's-hide shoes. The queue or
club was still worn by men of fashion; so were rich
broadcloth coats of every colour except scarlet, which
was seen only on the "backs of soldiers, Carolinians,
and dancing-masters." Winthrop Sargent, a Philadelphian
himself, writing of this time, says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Silver tankards and china punch-bowls were evidences of
prosperity, as were the small mirrors in wooden frames, and the
mahogany tea-boards that are still sometimes met with in the
lumber-rooms of old-time houses. Glass tumblers were rarely
seen, a dipper for the punch-bowl, or gourd or cup for the water-pail
supplied those who did not have recourse to the vessel itself."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This latter statement seems hardly compatible with
"elegance," but there were certainly great extremes to
be met with even in the Capitol City, as Philadelphia
was at that time.</p>

<p>When it became fashionable to have tables round or
oval, it was no longer possible to use forms or settles
at them. So chairs took their place, and we notice
with greater frequency in the inventories "sets" of
chairs, six, twelve, and occasionally twenty-four.
These early chairs, straight-backed (<a href="#Page_100">Figure 46</a>), with
rush or bass bottoms, or of carved wood or leather,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
were hard to sit upon, so cushions were provided in
large numbers and of varying degrees of elegance.
These rush-bottomed chairs with turned wood frames
remained in use for many years. They were made
with different degrees of elaboration, one of the two
in <a href="#Page_100">Figure 46</a> showing a more ornamental banister back
(<i>i. e.</i>, the vertical slats) than the other. These two
chairs have seen much service, but are uncommonly
well preserved, and belong to Mr. William M. Hoyt,
of Rochester, N. Y. They were frequently painted
dark green, a fashion said to have come to us from
Holland. As chairs grew more comfortable the
decrease in the number of cushions is very marked.</p>

<p>With the increase in comfort in household belongings
a corresponding increase in the elegance of dress
was visible. There was a "court circle" in America
as well as in England. Broadway, as early as 1700,
presented a brilliant sight at church time. Lord Bellomont
was governor, and Colonel Bayard and his wife
were citizens of wealth and importance. On such an
occasion as church-going, on a fine spring morning,
Mrs. Bayard wore no bonnet, but a "frontage", a sort
of head-dress of rows of muslin stiffened with wire.
She also wore a "steenkirk", or voluminous necktie,
which fell over her bodice. The skirt of her purple
and gold atlas gown was cut away to show her black
velvet petticoat edged with two silver orrices, and
short enough to show her green silk stockings and fine
embroidered shoes. Her hair was powdered and her
kerchief scented with rosewater.</p>

<p>The furniture in use at this time has been already
shown in Chapter I. Oak chairs, leather chairs, and
those of cane are all mentioned. We find entries of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
"12 cane chairs with black frames" (1712); "6 Spanish
leather chairs" (1703); "one fine chest of drawers,"
of maple (1703); "a fine chest of drawers of olive and
walnut wood" (1705) and other similar items.</p>

<p>Furniture was now being made in the Colonies in
quite large quantities, and New England was actively
engaged in the furniture business, which employed
many cabinet-makers. Salem had James Symond
as early as 1714, and others, with each succeeding
year. Lynn had John Davis by 1703, and Marblehead,
which was expected to become a great commercial
centre, had at least a dozen more or less celebrated
between 1729 and 1780. <a href="#Page_102">Figure 47</a> is an example of
home-made furniture. It is known to collectors as
the Connecticut chest, because this design is found
only in that vicinity. Quite a number of such chests
are in existance, all bearing the same pattern carved
on the panels. They are of oak, often with pine tops,
backs, and bottoms. The one shown has the top of
oak; the turned drops and ornaments are of pine
stained black; its height is 40 inches, width 48 inches,
and breadth 22 inches. It is at Deerfield, Mass.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century ministers were often glad
to turn their hands to some work which would eke out
their slender stipends. We have seen how Mr. Ripley
of Concord increased his. The Rev. Theophilus Pickering,
of Salem, in 1724, made furniture. Pieces are
still in existance which he made, sturdy and in good
order, showing that he put his best work and best
wood into this business, as he put his best thought
into his pulpit labour.</p>

<p>The woods used by these cabinet-makers embrace
all kinds, walnut, maple, cherry, nut-wood (hickory),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
poplar, ash, and pine. American dealers imported
mahogany also in quantities, and it was for sale in
planks as well as made up into furniture.</p>

<p>"New York Gazette and Weekly Mercury" for 1774
published the following advertisements.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"To be sold by Leonard Kip, A quantity of New Beef by the barrel,
Honey by the barrel or half barrel, Albany boards and planks,
Highland butter in firkins and European Goods. Which he will
sell very low for cash or short credit, at his store in Dock Street
opposite Mr. Gerardus Duyckinck's."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following also appeared in many issues of the
paper.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Mahogany Furniture, 3 elegant desks &amp; book cases, 1 chest upon
chest of drawers, 1 lady's dressing-chest &amp; bookcase, 3 desks &amp;
1 pr. card tables, 2 setts of chairs, 3 dining-tables &amp; 5 breakfast
tables, 1 clock-case furnished with a good plain 8 day clock, Sundry
stands, etc. The above articles are well made and most of
them are of wood of the first quality and will be sold as low as
any furniture of equal value in the city by Willett &amp; Pearsey, cabinet
&amp; chair-makers, at the sign of the clothes-press nearly opposite
the Oswego Market, at the end of Maiden Lane."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Philadelphia, renowned for its manufacture of
household goods, the trade was so large and important
that the "Journeyman's Cabinet &amp; Chair-maker's Philadelphia
Book of Prices" was issued. In a second
edition (1795) are given the prices of many local furniture-makers,
such as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A plain mahogany high-post bedstead £1. 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d</i>.</p>

<p>"A plain sofa 6 ft. long, with 6 legs, fast back &amp; no low rails.
£1. 8<i>s.</i> 0<i>d</i>."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The desk shown in <a href="#Page_105">Figure 48</a> is a piece found at
Bedford Springs, Pa., a place which was known as a
"resort" as early as 1778, and had houses with plastered
walls, quite an unusual luxury in country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
regions, though as these Springs were frequented by
the fashionable society of Philadelphia and New York,
who went for the waters, special effort was used to
make the place attractive. The desk is mahogany
and solid, not veneered. It has a roll-top of the style
made by Sheraton, which falls back behind the drawers
and cupboards. The brasses are new, and the lid has
been restored; otherwise the desk is as it was made. It
stood for many years in one of the little outside
houses near the main hotel, and when, a number of
years ago, a visitor asked to buy it, the proprietor told
him the piece was known as "Jimmy Buchanan's desk."
Mr. Buchanan was in the habit of spending his summers
at Bedford Springs and always occupied the room
where this desk was. In 1857, when as President
Buchanan he arrived at Bedford, the proprietors in his
honour had refurnished his room. They were congratulating
themselves that the President would be gratified
at what they had done for him, when he suddenly
came into the room and demanded in a rage what had
become of the desk. If it was not forthcoming he
would go elsewhere. He could use it, he said, to
write on, and then the drawers were roomy and just
suited him for his clean shirts. It is needless to say
that the desk was brought down from the garret, and
was never removed from the room when President
Buchanan visited there.</p>

<p class="caption">Illustration: Figure 51. WINDSOR CHAIRS.</p>
</div>

<p>The desk is in company suited to its age, the larger
powder-horn hanging above it being a veteran also. It
is seventeen inches long and ten inches broad at the
largest end. It bears the following inscription cut in
quaint old letters on lines drawn so that they should
go straight:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This is William Norton's Horn made at Qubeck y^e 10 day of
Aprill 1776. I powder with my Brother Ball we wound them all
that in Our way may chance to fall."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The smaller horn bears the date 1810, and the two
swords were used in the General Training days of the
first quarter of the nineteenth century. All these
relics belong to Anthony Killgore, Esq., of Flemington,
N. J.</p>

<p>During the first quarter of the eighteenth century,
and even a little earlier, houses were built with wainscoting
and panelling, and it was the fashion to build
into walls cupboards for the display of china and plate.
Frequently they were placed in the corner of the
room, and were either with or without doors. Such a
cupboard was called a "beaufait," which was sometimes
shortened to "bofet," or "buffet," according to
the taste of the owner. <a href="#Page_106">Figure 49</a> shows a specimen.
The house from which this beaufait came was built in
1696 in Vernon Place, Boston, Mass., by William
Clough. Two years later he sold it, and it passed
through several hands by inheritance and sale till in
1758 it was bought by Captain Vernon, who with various
members of his family held it for seventy-five
years. The cherub's heads which ornament the cupboard
are somewhat unusual on a piece of furniture of
this kind, and it has also a very handsome shell at the
top. It is now at the Old State House, Boston.</p>

<p>Mention is also made in many inventories of "Court
cupboards," and "livery cupboards." The former
were light movable shelves, making a kind of sideboard,
and used to display plate and porcelain. A
livery cupboard was somewhat similar. It had usually
but three shelves and stood upon four legs. It sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
had a drawer for linen, but no doors. Mugs and
cups were hung from the bottom of the shelves, and a
ewer stood below. These were put in what was called
the dining-parlour, a stately room on the second floor
never used to dine in. (See <a href="#Page_108">Figure 50</a> showing the
banquet room at Independence Hall, Philadelphia,
with the beautiful moulding, wainscot, and over-mantel
which were seen in handsome houses in the middle
of the eighteenth century.) It was many years before
the dining-room was set apart for meals. At first only
a screen gave privacy, but gradually the dining-room
grew in favour. The early dining-rooms held beds, as
well as the parlours, they being given to guests on
account of the warmth. Joint stools were there, and
Flanders chests, in which the mistress often rummaged,
so that the guest should see the goodly store of
clothes and linen owned by the family.</p>

<p>As was the custom in England, many wealthy men
had their furniture made to order, often in their own
houses, where the cabinet-makers came and worked.
Sometimes they imported their own woods, as in the
case of Mr. Champlin, a merchant of Newport, R. I.,
who brought home with him in 1762, from a voyage
in the West Indies, some logs of mahogany, from
which he had several pieces of furniture made. Watson,
in his "Annals of New York," says that the use
of what was foreign and modish was noted earlier in
New York before the Revolution than elsewhere.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"They earlier used carpets, wall-papers, foreign milliners, dress-makers,
Windsor chairs, glass utensils, jewelry, dentistry, watches,
umbrellas, stage-playbills, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Windsor chairs were advertised in 1768 as made and
sold by William Gautier in New York. He also had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
high-backed, low-backed, sack-backed chairs and settees,
and dining and low chairs. A pair of Windsor
chairs are shown in <a href="#Page_110">Figure 51</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>Carriages were imported in 1766 from Dublin, as also
men to keep them in repair. They were landaus, curricles,
sedans, and even sleighs with gildings, carvings,
and japan to suit. In 1774 there was advertised for
sale "A handsome Riding Chair with full set of harness,"
and an announcement was made that there was
"To be sold a Genteel Post-chaise."</p>

<p>The carpets referred to above were imported ones,
Turkey and Scotch. "Persian and plat carpeting"
was offered for sale in 1761 by H. Van Vleck. A later
advertisement announced: "There will be sold at
Public Auction, April 7, 1777, Two very handsome
Turkey carpets." Rag carpets were used as early as
1660, and private families who could afford it owned
their own looms. Sometimes those who wished extra
elegance bought the yarn and paid for the weaving.</p>

<p>In 1761, "Pennsylvania Stoves newly invented, both
round and square, to be sold by Peter Clopper" were
advertised in the "New York Gazette." These were,
no doubt, what became known as Franklin stoves.
This same year were also advertised wall-papers by
quite a number of firms in various cities: "A variety
of paper-hangings imported from London." "Flowered
papers," "printed papers," and "printed papers
for hanging rooms," were imported as early as 1752.
<a href="#Page_113">Figure 52</a> shows the fashionable wall-paper of about
this period. It is in the Cowles House, Deerfield,
Mass., and is in an excellent state of preservation.
The sofa below is of the late Sheraton or early
Empire, similar to the one belonging to Rev. Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Ripley and shown in <a href="#Page_85">Figure 36</a>. Some wall-paper of
equal elaboration is shown in the Frontispiece, which
gives the hallway of the famous "King Hooper
House," built at Danvers, Mass., now occupied by
Francis Peabody, Esq.</p>

<p>Wall-paper, however, was not very generally used,&mdash;just
why one cannot tell, but some of the gaily flowered
papers were used for window-shades. Curtains
for windows and beds were at this time very popular,
and it was the fashion of the time to have the window-
and bed-curtains alike. The materials were very
numerous and their names have a most unfamiliar
sound. There was perpetuana, Kitterminster, serge,
darnick (a coarse damask,) silke darnick, camlet,
mohair, fustian, seersucker, camac or camoca, bancour,
red and green paly-(vertical stripes of equal size,)
printed calico, checked and striped linen, India and
Patma chintzes, corded dimities, harrateen, lutestring,
moreens of all colours, fine French chintzes, Pompadour
chintzes, "fine laylock and fancy callicoes,"
and "muzlins." There were bed-cords, and fringes to
edge and trim all these materials, and the bed in full
dress was a very ornamental affair.</p>

<p>Beds varied in size and height in quite a remarkable
degree. The one shown in <a href="#Page_115">Figure 53</a> has a very wide
reputation, and is now to be seen at the rooms of the
Antiquarian Society, Concord, Mass. It is of mahogany,
with bandy legs and ball-and-claw feet. The
curtains are the original ones that came with the bed
and are worn in many places. They are very curious
showing agricultural scenes and domestic animals in
large numbers. These curtains were not intended to
be drawn, but to hang permanently in place, and there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
were to be inner curtains of "muzlin" or "callico" to
draw and keep out drafts. One peculiarity of this
bed is its extreme narrowness; it is intended for a
double bed and yet its width is only four feet, it was
included in the wedding outfit of Miss Martha Tufts,
who was married at Concord in 1774. The cabriole
leg and style of curtain lead to the supposition that
the piece is Dutch.</p>

</div>

<p>In February, 1768, Miss Harriott Pinckney was
married to Daniel Horry in "Charles Town," South
Carolina. This was one of twelve weddings that took
place that year, all the bridegrooms being wealthy
rice-planters. The furniture to fill the houses of these
rich couples was all brought from England, and the beds
were lofty mahogany ones, four-posters with tester, canopy,
curtains, and valances complete. The large heavy
posts for all twelve beds were said to be alike, and
were carved with rice-stalks, the heavy clustering
heads forming the capitals. So tall were these beds
that steps were necessary to climb into them, and
the ones belonging to Mrs. Horry were in existence a
few years ago.</p>

<p>In the "History and Present State of Virginia,"
1705, is the following paragraph relating to the
homes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"The private buildings are of late very much improved; several
Gentlemen having built themselves large Brick Houses of many
Rooms on a floor and several stories high, as also some Stone-Houses;
but they don't covet to make them lofty having extent
enough of Ground to build upon. They always contrive to have
large rooms that they may be cool in Summer. Of late they have
made their Stories much higher than formerly, and their windows
large and sasht with Cristal Glass, and within they adorn their
apartments with rich furniture."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>The eighteenth century was rightly called the
Golden Age of Virginia. The planter in his manor-house,
surrounded by his family, served by a vast
army of retainers, was like a feudal patriarch, though
his rule was milder. On the plantation itself were
produced all the necessaries of life; it was a little
community in itself. Wool was woven into clothing,
flax was spun, shoes were made, and blacksmithing
done. Luxuries such as books, wines, silks, laces, and
the more elegant household plenishings were brought
to the very wharf from London in the planters' own
ships in return for tobacco. The writer previously
quoted goes on to say, about the people themselves:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"They are such abominable ill husbands that, though their
country be overrun with wood, yet they have all their wooden
ware from England, their cabinets, chairs, tables, stools, chests,
boxes, cart-wheels, and all other things, even so much as their
bowls and birchen brooms, to the eternal reproach of their laziness."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although Beverly calls himself an "Inhabitant of
Virginia", it is curious that he was not aware that the
southern colonies were interdicted by special act of
legislature from trading with the Dutch or English
colonies. "Wooden ware" is especially mentioned as
being subject to "imposicon."</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 54. BED AT MOUNT VERNON.</p>
</div>

<p>A typical bed of the last quarter of the eighteenth
century is shown in <a href="#Page_116">Figure 54</a>. This bed belonged to
George Washington, and is in his bedroom at Mount
Vernon. It is said to be the one he used in his last
illness. Unlike the bed shown in <a href="#Page_115">Figure 53</a>, this bed
is of unusual proportions, being nearly as wide as it
is long. The small table between the doors shows
an excellent example of the Dutch foot. Upon it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
stands a small dressing-glass, so much in use at this
period, of very handsome black and gold lacquer.
Whenever General Washington had the opportunity
he added to the furniture and appointments of Mount
Vernon. Belvoir, the home of the Fairfax family,
was one of the most splendid of the mansions on the
Potomac. In 1774 its contents were sold at auction,
and Colonel George Washington bought goods to the
value of £200 sterling. Among the most important
lots were the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"1 mahogany shaving desk, 1 settee bed and furniture (£13), 4
mahogany chairs, 1 chamber carpet, 1 oval glass with gilt frame, 1
mahogany chest and drawers in Mrs. Fairfax's chamber, (£12. 10s)
1 mahogany sideboard, (£12. 5<i>s.</i>) 1 mahogany cistern and stand, 1
mahogany voider, 1 desk and 1 knife tray, 12 chairs &amp; 3 window
curtains from dining room (£31), 1 mahogany wash desk, (£1. 2<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i>)."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Among the smaller articles were several pairs of
andirons, tongs and shovels, bellows, brushes, toasting-forks,
and "1 hot rache in cellar," with many blankets,
19 coverlids, pillows, bolsters, bottles and pickle-pots,
wine-glasses and pewter water-plates. There were also
two tables, one "a mahogany spider-make tea-table,
£1 11<i>s.</i>" and "1 mahogany table £11," showing that
articles of this wood obtained good values even then.
The list of the goods in all of the rooms of Belvoir is
far too long to be given here, but in the dressing-room
connected with Colonel Fairfax's bedroom were
"1 oval glass in burnished gold, (£5 10<i>s.</i>), 1 mahogany
shaving-table, 1 mahogany desk (£16 16<i>s.</i>), 4 chairs
and covers, 1 mahogany settee bedstead, Saxon green,
covers for same, 1 mahogany Pembroke table, dogs,
shovel, tongs and fender."</p>

<p>It is also a matter of interest to see of what books a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
library consisted among people who were considered
to have a literary bent and to be extensive readers.
There is nothing "light" about it, and would to-day
be accounted very dull reading.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 55. BED AT SOMERVILLE, N. J.</p>
</div>

<p>A bed showing better the handsome solid posts is
given in <a href="#Page_118">Figure 55</a>. This is also associated with the
Father of his Country, for it is in the house at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
Somerville, N. J., occupied by him as headquarters during
one of his campaigns in the Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>In Chapter I a "bedsteade of carven oak" was
referred to as having been sent for to England by Mrs.
Lake, as a wedding-present for her daughter. It
could hardly have been such a very splendid piece of
furniture as that shown in <a href="#Page_121">Figure 56</a>, with its coat of
arms on the headboard, and the two beautiful foot-posts.
The draperies were intended to cover the two
head-posts, so that they were left plain. The old
easy-chair standing beside the bed has unfortunately
lost its feet, but they were the well-known ball-and-claw
pattern generally seen on this style of chair,
which was well calculated to keep off swirling draughts
from the head and back of the occupant. These chairs
were popular for a century or more, and were made
not only by English cabinet-makers like Chippendale
and Hepplewhite, but by the Dutch and Flemish
makers as well. They all have the bandy leg, but the
Dutch foot is sometimes used instead of the ball-and-claw.</p>

<p>But all the luxury and elegance were not absorbed
by the South and New York. Boston kept well to the
front. In 1700 Andrew Faneuil, Huguenot, came to
Boston and engaged in business. His brother was in
this country, too, and, he dying not long after, Andrew
assumed the care of, and took into business with himself,
first one and then a second nephew. They were
merchants and the following entries of consignments,
taken from their old ledgers, which are still in existence,
show the nature of their business. Besides
crapes, poplins, lawns, and silks, they had for sale durants
and duroys, osnaburgs, camblets, narrow, double
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
and cherry, with ingrains, silk druggets and calamancoes.
They also imported dishes, pans, and kettles,
"wooden lanthorns and tin ditto" (1725). Nor did they
neglect to provide amusement for their fellow townsmen,
for they imported "one-half gross man-in-the-moon
cards." Among other goods in this same invoice
were "1 chest muskets and one large pair looking-glasses."</p>

<p>Andrew Faneuil died in 1738, and his favourite
nephew and chief heir, Peter Faneuil, did not hesitate,
on account of the cost, to have an elaborate and
seemly funeral. Three thousand pairs of gloves were
distributed, and later two hundred mourning-rings
were given to intimate friends. Peter Faneuil, now a
wealthy young man by inheritance as well as by his
own exertions, lived in the old house with his maiden
sister. This same year, 1738, he sends to London for
"a handsome chariot with two setts of harness," and
a coachman warranted to remain sober. A few months
later he writes for china and glass from England, for
table-cloths and napkins from France, and he sends
for silver spoons, "forks with three prongs," all to
have upon them the Faneuil crest. "Let them be
very neat and handsome," says he.</p>

<p>The next order is for silver candlesticks and a
punch-bowl of silver holding two gallons, also to be
decorated with the family crest. His clothes were
also a matter of concern, and he sends to London a
pattern of a piece of Duncy, orders buttons of the
newest fashion to match it, of mohair silk, and knee-straps.
Nor is he less scrupulous about his sister's
affairs, and sent all the way back to London six pairs
of stockings which had been sent of worsted instead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
of "3 pairs thread hose, and 1 pair Galous hose, and
2 pair of thread ditto."</p>

</div>

<p>Boston at this time (1738) seems to have had some
luxuries demanded by New York, for an order comes
to Peter Faneuil to send there "a dozen red Turkey
or Morocker leather chairs." One of these easy-chairs
cost £14 14<i>s.</i> In 1742 Peter Faneuil gave to the city
of Boston the hall called by his name. It was built
of home-made brick (Salem had a brick-kiln as early
as 1629), but the glass in the windows was brought
from England in Mr. Faneuil's own ships. The first
furnishings bought by the selectmen for Faneuil Hall
were "two pairs of brass candlesticks with steel snuffers,
and a poker, for the town's use."</p>

<p>Peter Faneuil's inventory, filed in 1742, contains
items under 158 heads, and makes quite a volume of
manuscript. It includes not only his and his uncle's
gatherings in the way of household goods, but the
contents of warehouses, cellar, coach-house, and stables.
The house was handsomely furnished. In the best
room were, "12 carved vineered chairs &amp; couch, £105;
1 pier glass, £100." Other costly articles were, "1
buffet with parcel of china delph &amp; glass, £199."
There were, besides,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"1 chimney glass and arms; 1 marble table; 1 large Turkey
carpet; 1 compleat brass sett, hearth-dogs, tongs, shovel, and
bellows; 1 copper tea-table; cups, saucers, tea-pot, stand, bowl and
sugar-dish; 3 alabaster bowls and stands; 1 large oval mahogany
table, 12 plain walnut-frame leather-bottom chairs; 1 prospect of
Boston, 2 landskips on copper, and the Temple of Solomon."</p></blockquote>

<p>The "Great Centre Hall" must have made a quaint
appearance, since here hung the fire apparatus; "1
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
large entry lantern; 12 baggs and buckets, and books
£50."</p>

<p>The sleeping-rooms were handsomely equipped, and
each was furnished with its appropriate colour. The
list includes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"1 harrateen bed, bedstead and window curtains, matrass
and two green silk quilts and feather-bed, £65</p>

<p>3 scones with arms</p>

<p>1 bureau, 1 table, 1 pr. brass-faced dogs, 1 fire-shovel, tongs
bellows, and one Turkey carpet, £107"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Peter Faneuil's own room was not lacking in comforts,
as is shown by the enumeration of:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"1 silver-hilted sword, 1 pair of pistols and 1 powder-flask,
£15; 1 case 6 razors, bone penknife, strap, 2 bottles, looking-glass
tipt with silver; yellow mohair bed-counterpane, feather-bed,
bolster, 2 false pillows, false curtains, 6 chairs, 1 great chair, 2
stools, window curtains," etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The furnishings of this room, exclusive of the small-arms,
was valued at £245. He had "6 lignum-vitæ
chocolate-cups lined with silver", which were probably
Dutch, for among the goods of Sara Van der Vulgen,
of Schenectady, at about this same period, was a great
"saler" or salt-cellar, made of lignum-vitæ, bound
with silver and standing on three little silver feet.</p>

<p>In Mr. Faneuil's kitchen were many utensils of
copper, pots, pans, and kettles, together with an
"engine and cistern." He had many jewels, 1,400
ounces of plate, including a shaving-basin worth £40.
There were silver snuff-boxes, seven gold rings, and
"chrystall buttons set in gold." Just before he died
he sent to London for "six gross of the very best
London King Henry's cards", for his store no doubt,
for cards were becoming more popular among the
descendants of the Puritans than they had been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1729 Governor Burnet, of New York and Massachusetts,
died, leaving behind him a long list of valuable
personal goods. He owned as many as seventy
chairs and twelve tables. The chairs were of mahogany
and walnut, with leather or bass bottoms, and one
easy-chair was covered with silk. Twenty-four chairs
had seats of red leather, a noble set, and there are two
chairs now in the Yale University Library which
belonged to Governor Burnet, and which are of the
exact style of what we call Chippendale. They were
made more than twenty-five years before the "Director"
was published, but are made of mahogany with
richly carved knees, ball-and-claw feet, with carved
and ornamentally pierced splats, handsome upper rail
curved and ending in the little ears before mentioned.</p>

<p>In all the inventories of wealthy and poor alike
there is mention of candlesticks, sconces, girandoles,
etc. The "entry lanthorns," as well as the perforated
tin ones, were made to hold bits of candles and
lamps are few and far between. It was not
till 1783 that the flat-wick lamp was invented, the
lamps before that time being pewter and glass, with
small, round, string wicks, burning whale oil. When
the question of lighting was so difficult, it is no wonder
that the pioneers were in the habit of going to
bed at dark and rising with the sun. The bayberry
or candleberry was of recognized value, and the laws
of Brookhaven, as early as 1687, forbade the gathering
of the berries before September 15, under a penalty
of a fine of fifteen shillings.</p>

<p>Candlewood, as pine knots were called, was burned
in the fireplace on long winter evenings. The manufacture
of home-made candles was one of the tests by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
which the careful housewife was distinguished, dozens
of candles being made and laid away in the candle-box.
In 1753, in the "New York Gazette," were
advertised "Green mould candles for sale, at the Old
Slip Market." The old moulds, generally of tin, were
passed around among neighbours in country districts
and villages. "Dipping" candles was a trying business,
and required skill and experience on the part of
the dipper. Lustres holding many candles were used
on festive occasions, and four or six lights were
often set in branches on either side of mirrors.
Many candlesticks with cut-glass prisms are still to be
found, and betty-lamps, crude little metal lamps, were
often used for bedrooms or in sick-rooms. "Glass
lamps and chamber lamps" were advertised as early as
1759, and "fine large lamps at 20 shilling each" in 1752.
Candle-screens, "red, green, gilt and black japanned
candlesticks with snuffers and extinguishers", were
on sale in 1773, and no card-table was complete without
at least a pair of tall massive candlesticks of
Sheffield plate.</p>

<p>By 1760 the newspapers contain advertisements of
what are really luxuries. James Gilliland, dealer in
earthen, delf, and glass in Wall street, New York, has
the following named articles: "Enamelled and cabbage
teapots [Wedgwood, no doubt], cut and ground
glass decanters, tumblers, punch and wine glasses."</p>

<p>The fair sex is by no means forgotten, and even
during the stress of the great struggle for freedom her
appearance is considered. Many times the following
announcement appears: "The Venetian Paste so well-known
to the ladies for enameling the Hands, neck
and face of a lovely white" is for sale by Hugh Gaine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
printer. Nesbit Deane offers hats "to exceed in fineness,
cut, colour, and cock." He also has "Ladies'
white riding hats." "Goods for the approaching season"
are duly set forth in the spring advertisements,
and "Sagothies, Hairbine, white silk embroidered and
tambour with gold shades" are recommended for
waistcoats. There was also to be bought "gold and
silver vellum lace, gold and silver bullion fringe, silk
sashes and hat feathers for the gentlemen of the militia
and army." "Spittlefield corded tabbey, peneaffcoes
and peling sattens" were to be had in all
colours for ladies' use, while "Prunells and Oxford
crape" were provided for the "Rev'd clergy."</p>

<p>The servant question was a burning issue even at
that time, and there are quantities of rewards offered
for runaway slaves and apprentices. Some desperate
householder advertised in March, 1777:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<span class="smcap">Wanted.</span> A cook, black or white, male or female. Such a
person will meet with good encouragement by applying to Hugh
Gaine, printer."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those who did not wish to be annoyed by the labour
of housekeeping could be accommodated with "Diet
and Lodging," also, by applying to Hugh Gaine,
printer.</p>

<p>Other advertisements read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[1761] "Morrison, peruke maker from London, dresses ladies and
gentlemen's hair in the politest taste. He has a choice parcel of
human, horse, and goat's hairs to dispose of."</p>

<p>[1768] "James Daniel, wig-maker and hairdresser also operates
on the teeth, a business so necessary in this city."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wigs were an important feature in the costume of
the men. They were subject to tax and were a good
source of revenue. The Treasurer of the Colony of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
New York, as early as 1732, reported that he had
received from the tax on wigs the sum of £9 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d</i>.
This tax was called&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"a wise and prudent measure, because it was the fashion for
even young boys to conceal their own hair under large and spacious
wigs. To repress a custom so absurd, or to make a source
of revenue has been the object of the legislature."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we paid, and gladly, for our wigs, even though
visiting Englishmen spoke of us thus: "The people,
both in town and country, are sober, industrious, and
hospitable, though intent upon gain."</p>

<p>All travellers mention our hospitality. Prince de
Broglie writes in 1782:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"M. de la Luzerne took me to tea at Mrs. Morris, wife of the
Secretary of the Treasury of the United States. Her house is
small, but well ordered and neat, the doors and tables of superb
well-polished mahogany, the locks and andirons of polished brass,
the cups arranged symetrically, the mistress of the house good-looking
and very grey."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Morris was considered to have one of the handsomest
houses in Philadelphia, and it was not at all
the mode to display one's own hair if it had turned
grey, so the fact of Mrs. Morris doing so seems to
have impressed the volatile Frenchman.</p>

<p>Another traveller, Captain Laurence Butler, writes
from Westmoreland, Virginia, in 1784, to Mrs. Craddock,
an Englishwoman, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"When balls are given, which is very frequent, the company stay
all night (not as in your country), for every gentleman has ten or
fifteen beds, which is sufficient for the ladies, and the men shift
for themselves."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These beds were the high four-posters, carved and
draped, and ten or fifteen seems a liberal allowance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
for every household. One Alexander Mackraby,
visiting Philadelphia in 1768, before the Revolution,
writes home: "I could hardly find myself out this
morning in a most elegant crimson silk damask bed."
Poor indeed was the householder who did not manage
to have one "feder bed," or one of flock, or something
soft, and there were always pillows, bolster, coverlids,
and blankets, though sometimes, judging from the
inventories, the owners did not care particularly about
sheets.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<small>COLONIAL AND LATER PERIODS&mdash;<i>Continued</i>.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have seen by the middle of the century, 1750,
how many comforts were obtainable at the large centres,
and how many cabinet-makers were at work in
the Colonies. About 1756 the ways and people are
described thus:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"New York is one of the most social places on the continent.
The men collect themselves into weekly evening clubs. The
ladies in winter are frequently entertained either at concerts of
musick or assemblies, and make a very good appearance. They
are comely and dress well, and scarce any of them have distorted
shapes. Tinctured with a Dutch education they manage their
families with becoming parsimony, good providence, and singular
neatness."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Twenty-five years later the British officers quartered
in New York made life there very gay. Fox-hunting was
practiced till 1781, and was advertised in the "Royal
Gazette" as taking place on Ascot Heath, in Brooklyn.
Horse-racing took place on Hempstead Plains,
Long Island, for life in general was a full copy of
what was going on in England. The "New York
Gazette" of June 4, 1770, tells us that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"a Great Horse-Race was run off on Hempstead Plains for a considerable
wager, which engaged the attention of so many in the
city that upward of seventy chairs and chaises were carried over the
ferry from hence, and a far greater number of horses, so that it
was thought that the number of Horses on the Plains at the Races
far exceeded a thousand."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>The comparatively peaceful sport of horse-racing
was not the only one indulged in. Bull-baiting was
not at all unusual. The posters for this amusement
were headed "Pro Bono Publico," and in the "New
York Mercury" for August, 1774, John Cornell
announces that there will be "a Bull Baited on Town
Hill at 3 o'clock every Thursday during the season."
Town Hill was Columbia Street, near Cranberry
Street, Brooklyn Heights.</p>

<p>On March 24, 1777, in the "New York Mercury" was
the following advertisement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"On Thursday At the Theatre in John St. On next Thursday
evening will be performed a Tragedy called Venice Preserved.
With an Occasional Prologue. To which will be added a Farce
called 'The Lying Valet.' The Characters by the Gentlemen of the
Army and Navy."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for clothes, of course the people followed the
English styles, and copies of such magazines as "The
Maccaroni Magazine or Monthly Intelligence of the
Fashions &amp; Diversions," found their way to America.
Here is an extract from the issue October, 1772:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Hats are rising behind and falling before. The blazing gold
loop and full-moon button is now totally exploded, and succeeded
by a single narrow looping, broad hatband, and pin's-head button.
In full dress the three buttons zigzag with the foretop à la Grecque.
Roses are entirely confined to Cheapside, and bags are increasing
daily. The late stunting of coats having promoted the growth of
skirts, the pockets are capable of holding conveniently a tolerable-sized
muslin handkerchief and smelling bottle. Shoes are decreased
in heels two inches, and cut like a butter-boat to show the clocks of
the stockings."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"The Magazine a la Mode, or Fashionable Miscellany,"
particularly adapted to the People of both
Sexes, and calculated to convey early and useful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
information to those who are in any way concerned in
furnishing articles of Dress, either in "Town or Country,"
appeared in 1777. From one of these useful
repositories we learn under date of 1786 that grass-green
was the fashionable colour for gentlemen's suits,
that the hair was dressed à la Taureau, and that watch-keys
were remarkable for size and weight.</p>

<p>In 1760, pattern-books published in London were to
be found in America for the benefit of native cabinet-makers,
as the following advertisement duly sets
forth:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"John Rivington of Hanover Square has for sale many books
for cabinet makers, joiners, etc., and calls particular attention to a
new work called Household Furniture for the year 1760, by a
society of Upholsterers, Cabinet-makers, etc., containing upwards
of 180 Designs consisting of Tea-Tables, Dressing, Card, Writing,
Library and Slab tables, Chairs, Stools, Couches, Trays, Chests,
Tea-Kettles, Bureaus, Beds, Ornamental Bed Posts, Cornishes,
Brackets, Fire-Screens, Desk and Book Cases, Sconces, Chimney-Pieces,
Girandoles, Lanthorns, etc., with scales."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not a paper but had advertisements of furniture
offered for sale. Thus in 1774 we find:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"To be sold at private sale a large black walnut cupboard with
a set of Delft, a large pier looking-glass, one pair of sconces, 3
large gilt frame pictures, and sundry other articles."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the same number of the "Weekly Mercury," and in
many succeeding issues appears the following notice:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A scheme for the disposal of a large quantity of silver-plated
furniture by lottery. The owner is a Philadelphian."</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Figure 59. MAHOGANY DESK AND CHEST OF DRAWERS.</p>
</div>

<p>In <a href="#Page_128">Figure 58</a> are shown two looking-glasses of styles
that were fashionable about the middle of the eighteenth
century. One of them is dated 1749, of mahogany
handsomely carved, and further embellished with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
ornaments of chiselled brass, a beading of it being
next to the glass. It rests upon two mirror-knobs,
which were screwed into the walls to support looking-glasses,
and the collection of which is such a pleasing
hobby to-day. The central ornament on the top is
missing. The other glass is of carved wood gilded,
and is now in Memorial Hall, Philadelphia. It hung
for many years in the fine old house "Belmont," and
is of the very finest style. The broken-arch cornice is
finished with rosettes, and the central ornament is not
the usual urn, but something more ornate.</p>

<p>There are constant notices of mahogany for sale,
such as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A cargo of fine mahogany for sale by Anthony Van Dam,
Jan'y 17, 1774."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In May of the same year John Morton advertises&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"the largest and most elegant assortment of mahogany or gilt
oval looking-glass frames ever imported in this city."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>William Melbourn advertises also, in 1774, over a
hundred items, among them are the following, showing
that "small wares" were easily to be obtained:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"White and green ivory table and desert knives and forks.</p>

<p>Ditto with silver caps and ferrils. Ditto black ebony with caps
and ferrils. Also Black horn, camwood, centre-bone split buck,
sham stag table knives and forks. Carving and oyster knives.
Neat mahogany and fish skin knife boxes. Mahogany and fish
skin razor cases. Plated coffee pots and spoons. Mahogany tea
chests. Merry Andrew, Harry, and Mogul's playing cards, Pearl
and ivory fish and counters, Mustard and Marrow spoons."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Memorial Hall, Philadelphia, is a set of table
knives with green ivory handles, like those advertised
in the first item, and looking at the end of the blades
we can no longer doubt that the use of two-pronged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
forks was supplemented by a dexterous manipulation
of the knife-blades. Writing-desks or scrutoirs, or
desks and bookcases, or even desks fitted into the
drawers of a bureau, had become pieces of furniture
that were found in every well-to-do home.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Page_130">Figure 59</a> is shown one of the early styles of
make, about the middle of the eighteenth century.
This particular desk was brought from England, is of
mahogany, and is in good condition except that the
front feet have been restored. It still has the original
brasses and the overlapping drawers. It has several
secret drawers where during the Revolution the private
documents of the owner were concealed. During
the Civil War its secret drawers were again in use, and
effectually concealed papers of value. It has never
passed out of the possession of the family whose ancestors
brought it over, and it belongs to Miss Hite,
of Waynesboro, Va. The two-drawer chest beside
it is of a much earlier period. The mouldings
make the chest part resemble two drawers, but the top
opens as is usual. The handles on the desk are of the
shape used so much by Hepplewhite on his bureaus and
sideboards, while those on the chest are an earlier form
of the well-known willow pattern of brasses and are fastened
in by wires. The earliest patterns of handles were
the knob and drop, which were used on furniture before
1700. These were succeeded by others which were fastened
in by wire, and these again were replaced by handles
which were affixed with nut and screw. On page
224 are shown the different styles of handles, and their
approximate dates. The chest is of mahogany, with
bracket foot. This is a most unusual and interesting
piece.</p>

<p>At the time of the Revolution there was comfort
generally in most of the large cities at least. In 1776
there were sent to Cold Spring, for the use of the
army, the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"2 Mah'y tables, 6 Rush Bottom chairs, 4 Mah'y Rush Bottoms,
and 2 small bedsteads, a kitchen table, a new case of bottles, a
Coffee Mill, Brass Scales and Waights, 2 Kitchen Tramels, 2
pickel Tubs and 2 Wash Tubs, an Iron hooped Pail and a soap
barrel mostly full of soap and the Ticke of a Stra bed. Value
£20."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The works at Cold Spring were destroyed, and the
goods were never used, but the Government's strong-box
paid for them.</p>

<p>Cornelis Van Santvoordt, who lived at Esopus, near
Kingston, N. Y., when it was burned by the British
October 16, 1777, put in a claim for damages for £54
17<i>s.</i> 3<i>d</i>.
a large variety of goods, as may be seen from the following

<p>This inventory is somewhat unusual from the number
of "Chaina" articles enumerated, and among all
the items there are but six chairs and not a stool.
This claim, with many others, is recorded in the "New
York Records of the Revolution," and it was paid out
of the "strong-box." This box was not a mythical
object at all, but a veritable chest. Gerard Bancker
was State Treasurer for twenty years. During the
Revolution the iron chest moved about from one place
to another like the Continental Congress, and the
Treasurer went with it. According to a custom of
the times Mr. Bancker took the chest with him when
he retired from office. His family kept it for a
hundred years, but with many other relics it was sold
in Philadelphia, in 1898, by one of his descendants.</p>

<p>There were various patterns of combinations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
desks and bookcases, and of desks and bureaus. There
were the high, wide ones of Chippendale or Sheraton,
that would almost fill one side of a room. There were
small ones with desk below and shelves above, and
occasionally there were such great ones as that shown
in <a href="#Page_132">Figure 60</a>. This piece of furniture is so tall and
massive that it could not have been accommodated in
any save a large house. It is over eight feet tall and
five feet three inches wide. It is of a light mahogany,
with pillars of Empire style and very handsome brasses.
The lid of the desk folds back on itself and
below it is a drawer and cupboard. The handsomest
things about the bookcase are the glass doors with
Gothic tracery. The date of this piece is about the
first decade of the nineteenth century. The four legs
on the front are of unusual elegance. It belongs to
the Historical Society at Albany.</p>

<p>Quite as interesting as the inventories of property
left by will are some old records in the State Library,
New Jersey, called a "Record of the Damages done by
the British and their adherents to the Inhabitants of
Middlesex Co., New Jersey." This contains the
inventories made by six hundred and fifty persons who
suffered from the depredations of the plundering Hessians
and the English soldiery. The lists extend over
the years from 1776 to 1782 inclusive, but the worst
mischief was done in the time from December, 1776,
to June, 1777. There were eighteen hundred horses
taken, and these form a single item. That the settlers
were good livers the following inventory of one patriot
shows. He lost&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"4 hogsheads of cider, &frac12; pipe of madeira, 10 gallons brandy,
7 gallons Jamaica brandy, &frac12; barrel cherry Rum, barrel Porter."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>The inventory does not state his business, but we trust
from appearances that he kept a "public."</p>

<p>Another list reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Three cupboards of Dutch make as good as new, also three
large Bibles 1 Dutch and 2 English."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>David Harriott, of Middlesex County, was completely
stripped by the enemy. Among many items
were&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"a set of Homespun curtains wove with damask flowers, one ditto
of white in large damask flowers, and one ditto of double dimons."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Napkins, quilts, bedspreads, and sheets, as well as
large-flowered damask table-cloths and linen covers
testify to the industry of the women of the family.
The good wife lost her long gowns and short gowns,
her "shifts of 500 linen," handkerchiefs of gauze, lawn,
and linen, aprons of new flowered lawn, fine linen and
homespun, 3 caps of cambric and lawn, all new, and
even two bibs for a child. They took all of David's
clothes and his silver teaspoons and buckles, smashed
his windows and doors, broke down his partitions,
drove off his cattle, and did not leave him so much as
"a bed, a piggin, a trammel, or a gridiron."</p>

<p>Jacob Hyer was another sufferer. His house must
have been one of considerable size and well furnished.
There are many items, among them&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"5 fluted brass candlesticks, 2 pr. common ditto, 1 doz. iron
ditto, 10 pr. snuffers; 11 feather beds with bolsters and pillows,
etc."</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="caption">Figure 63. FRENCH BED.</p>
</div>

<p>The enemy left him nothing, even taking his "Iron
chain for Smoke Jack." Much of the furniture listed
in these inventories was evidently of American make,
for the woods mentioned are bilstead, gum pine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
walnut, cherry, or red cedar. The last was the favorite.
"Bilstead" was maple.</p>

<p>The beds were chiefly of three styles, field beds,
high four-posters with testers and valance, and low
four-posters, with an occasional "English" or "French"
bed. There were beds much plainer than the carved
ones we so much admire, but in any case the bed was
the most valuable household possession, as it had
always been. In 1640 William Southmead's house in
Gloucester, Mass., is valued at £8, and his feather-bed,
bedstead, and appurtenances at the same sum. In
1628 a pair of sheets was furnished to each Massachusetts
Bay Colonist. Linen and flannel sheets were the
ones in use. After spinning became universal and
flax abundant, homespun sheets abounded,&mdash;"20 and
1 pr." is not an unusual number; and where there
were several daughters whose chests had to be filled,
the number was many times greater. Table linen also
was of domestic manufacture.</p>

<p>One of the fashionable patterns of beds shown in
the English books imported into the Colonies, and
made by American cabinet-makers, was known as the
"field bed." The one shown in <a href="#Page_134">Figure 61</a> is in the
Whipple House, Ipswich, and is draped with the netting
curtains, heavily dotted and fringed, which were
customary in its day. Early in 1700 there was an auction
sale of Governor Cornbury's effects in New
York, and the following advertisement concerning
them:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A fine yellow Camblet bed lined with silk and trimmed with fine
lace, which came from London. One fine field bedstead and curtains.
Some blue cloth lately come from London for liveries and
some broad gold lace. A very fine medecine chest with a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
variety of valuable medecines. A parcel of sweetmeats and jelly
glasses. A case of 12 knives and 12 forks with silver handles. A
large iron fireplace and iron bars all to be seen at the Fort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seemed as if the field bed had been made here, as it
is specified that several of the other articles came from
London. "The Journeyman's Cabinet &amp; Chair-makers
Philadelphia Book of Prices" gives in 1795 the price
of a mahogany field bed, with sloped roof, at £1 7<i>s.</i>,
while one of poplar, with the roof sloped each way,
cost but one pound. The carving of the posts was of
course extra and was to be paid for according to time.
Each inch that the bed was longer than six feet and
wider than four feet was to be charged for at the rate
of two pence per inch. This may be the reason why
many of the beds were so narrow. It is often stated
that the field bed was in use for a few years only,
about the middle of the 18th Century, while in fact it
was here, imported and of domestic make for fully one
hundred years, and I am by no means sure that Governor
Cornbury's was among the earliest.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig064.jpg" alt="Figure 64. HIGHBOY." width="279" height="600" />
<p class="caption">Figure 64. HIGHBOY.</p>
</div>


<p>Great attention was paid to the draping and arranging
of the curtains, valances, and testers of the high
four-posters. Heavy materials of silk and woollen were
used, as well as cotton stuffs. Men paid great attention
to the colourings of their bed furniture, as we
have seen in several inventories, and Horace Walpole
chose for his own bed at Strawberry Hill purple cloth
lined with white satin, and bunches of feathers on the
tester. Hepplewhite spent much pains on the details
of his beds, and recommended that the valance be
made very full, in which case it was called the "petticoat
valance." There were also elaborate details for
tying back the curtains and trimming them with gimp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
and fringe. The bed-drapings, even in early days,
were often very valuable. Col. Francis Epes, of Henrico
Co., Va., has in his inventory dated October 1,
1678:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"One large new feather bed with camlett curtains and double
vallins lind with yellow silke, bolster, pillow, counterpane, Rodds
and hooks tops and stands, 1 curtaine and some Fringe damnified
£24 5<i>s.</i> 0<i>d</i>."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The low-post bed was also a very handsome piece of
furniture, and in many cases the post was surmounted
by a pineapple, like the example shown in <a href="#Page_134">Figure 62.</a>
This bed has passed through a career of violent contrasts,
and it is only within a year that the four posts
were rescued from a barn, where they afforded convenient
roosts for poultry. The side and head and foot
boards had passed entirely out of sight, no doubt in
some moment of stress they had fed the family cooking-stove.
The missing parts have been restored in
solid mahogany, and it makes a very handsome piece
of furniture. It belongs to Mr. William M. Hoyt, of
Rochester, N. Y. The acanthus leaves on the lower
parts of the legs are unusually handsome. The posts
are 63 inches high, and the brass drops which conceal
the screw-holes have been restored from a bed of the
same period.</p>

<p>An unusually elegant example of the French bed is
the one given in <a href="#Page_136">Figure 63</a>. This bed is of rosewood,
with legs of splendidly carved dolphins, and on the
side rails and rolling ends are very rich ormolu decorations
cut from solid brass. The medallions directly
over the legs show Fame blowing her trumpet, and
the rams' heads terminating the head and foot boards
where they rest upon the wood above the stars are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
solid brass also. This bed has been many years in
this country, and stood in the bridal chamber or guest-room
of the old Van Rensselaer Manor House at Albany,
N. Y. This room was situated on the ground
floor to the right of the front door.</p>

<p>A most necessary piece of furniture which every
housekeeper endeavoured to own was some form of
"highboy," as it has come to be called, or a chest-on
chest of drawers. <a href="#Page_138">Figure 64</a> depicts a fair example of
the highest style of perfection to which these articles
reached. Few are found more ornate than this. The
wood is mahogany, and is richly carved on the knees,
with the upper and lower drawers ornamented with
shell and scrolls. The escutcheons and handles are original,
and the only defect is the loss of the two ornaments
which decorated either side of the top. The date of
this chest of drawers is anywhere from 1750 to about
1780, the overlapping drawers making it more likely
to approximate the earlier date. Belonging to about
the same period is the corner cupboard shown in Figure
65. This is of cherry, with the broken arch-cornice
and Gothic door. It has turned posts with rosettes
which Sheraton often used, and the cupboard doors
overlap and are panelled. The back of the cupboard is
of pine, as are the shelves. The wood is a rich dark
colour and unpolished. Similar pieces, though not
exactly in this form, are to be met with in Virginia
and are doubtless of native manufacture.</p>

<p>American makers used not only mahogany, cedar,
ash, elm, pine, maple, cherry, poplar, and walnut, but
could inlay with "King, tulip, rose, purple, snake,
zebra, Alexandria, panella, yew, and maple." There
were cabinet-makers in every town, and many of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
put out as handsome work as their contemporaries in
London. In Chapter V mention has been made of
the cabinet-makers of the eighteenth century, but furniture
was made in the Colonies even before that.
The native joiners began to work as early as 1622, for
Phineas Pratt, of Weymouth, Mass., was what we now
call a cabinet-maker, and before 1700 Boston had at
least 25 cabinet-makers whose names appear in various
records. We have also spoken of Connecticut chests,
and their manufacture somewhere in that State.
There is also another style known as the Hadley chest.
Mr. Lockwood, in his fine work on furniture, places
the date of these chests as ranging from 1690 to 1720.
They come in one-, two-, and three-drawer patterns,
varying in height from 32&frac12; inches in one-drawer size
to 46 inches for the three-drawer style. The peculiarity
of these chests is their decoration, their shape being
similar to other chests of the same period. In addition
to being carved they are stained as well,&mdash;red, mulberry,
and black being the colours chosen. On the
central panel of the front the initials of the owner were
usually roughly carved; the decoration of the chest,
confined to the front, being a rude vine, while the
sides are panelled. The top, body of drawers, and
back of chest are always pine, the thrifty New England
craftsman saving his hardwood for places where
it would show. There is a very fine specimen of these
Hadley chests in the Museum at Deerfield, Mass.
Several more are in collections gathered in Massachusetts
or adjoining States. The black-stained pine
ornaments do not always mark a piece as of domestic
manufacture, for pear-wood was used by the Dutch,
and even occasionally by the English, stained black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
to imitate ebony, which was always more or less
costly.</p>

<p>After 1725 there was considerable travel by merchants,
and to a small extent by others bent on
pleasure. Inns became of importance, and brought
in good incomes to their owners. Abel Chapin kept
a tavern at Chicopee, Mass., in 1730, and some few
leaves of his account-book still remain. The records
of the bar are the most numerous entries, and he sold
there "Rhum &amp; Cyder", bowls of punch and mugs
of flip, and sometimes "Shugar, seed-corne, salt, and
molasses." When this prosperous innkeeper died he
left personal property valued at £400, and his real
estate was worth £1,300. There were six hundred
items mentioned in his inventory among the household
furnishings, including iron, pewter, and brass
ware with some china and glass. There is also special
mention of "36 linen sheets, sixteen blankets, eleven
woolen sheets, 6 table cloths and 21 towels." The
inventory of his wardrobe shows richness for those
days, and justifies his mother's statement that she had
one son who was too rich. The inventory begins with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"2 Great Cotes, 1 srait Body Cote, 1 pare lether Britches, 1 pare
shues, 4 pare pumps, 1 hat, a black Velvet Vest, 1 pare Velvet
Britches, 9 pare hose, 4 fine shirts, 6 common shirts, shoe
Buckles."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His brother, a bachelor, died in 1747, and also had
much worldly geer. He had "cotes and jackets of
Camlet, serge and Broadcloth", and "some shirts,
some more shirts, and some fine shirts."</p>

<p>There was no longer such great stress for the necessaries
of life, in the Connecticut Valley at least,
though there was still hardship and danger a plenty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Game and wild fowl abounded in the woods, and
the rivers were full of fish. There is on record a
single catch in one night of 6,000 shad and 90 salmon,
six men being at work. Each householder was
required to keep at least three sheep, and these, with
the fields of flax, supplied bedding and clothing.</p>

<p>The Wayside Inn, South Sudbury, Mass., is still
standing to show what a handsome and hospitable
dwelling one of these old-fashioned inns was. In
<a href="#Page_49">Figure 18</a>, is shown the old dining-room,
looking to-day pretty much as it did a century
ago. On the left is a handsome lowboy with carving,
and from the little alcove on the right many a steaming
glass of flip or negus was served to cold and weary
travellers. The dining-room was the centre of hospitality
in the later Colonial days, as the kitchen had
been in the earlier period. There was no handsomer
or more hospitable entertainer than John Hancock,
of Boston. In September, 1778, he gave a dinner to
Count D'Estaing, the French Admiral, and his officers
and other dignitaries. There was such a large company
that the spacious ball-room at the Hancock
House was not large enough, so Faneuil Hall was
engaged for the occasion. All contemporary accounts
agree that it was a very splendid affair and went off
with great <i>éclat</i>. The following amusing glimpse
behind the scenes shows Mr. Hancock's anxiety
about the provisions for this same dinner.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Monday Noon,</span> 30 Aug. 1778.<br /></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;The Phillistines are coming upon me on
Wednesday next at Dinner. To be Serious, the Ambassador,
etc., etc., are to dine with me on Wednesday, and I have nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
to give them, nor from the present prospect of our Market do I
see that I shall be able to get anything in Town. I must beg the
fav^r of you to Recommend to my man Harry where he can get
some chickens, Ducks, Geese, Hams, Partridges, Mutton or anything
that will save my reputation in a dinner, and by all means
some Butter. Be so good as to help me and you will much oblige
me. Is there any good Mellons or Peaches or any good fruit
near you? Your advice to Harry will much oblige me. Excuse
me, I am very troublesome. Can I get a good Turkey? I
walked in Town to-day. I dine on board the French Frigate
to-morrow, so you see how I have Recovered. God bless you.
If you see anything good at Providence, do Buy it for me.

<p>Apparently the friend came to his assistance. The
appearance of the company must have been very
gay, for bright apparel was not confined to ladies
alone.</p>

<p>Seven years later James Bowdoin, the Governor of
Massachusetts (1785) on a review day at Cambridge,
wore a grey wig, cocked hat, white broadcloth coat
and vest, red small-clothes, and black-silk stockings.
Thomas Jefferson wore a white coat and red breeches.
The ladies were looked out for also, and&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"a neat assortment of women's and children's stays, also hoops
and quilted coats, also men's and women's shoes from England"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>were advertised in the "New York Mercury." As early
as 1761 Mr. H. Levy offered for sale Hyson tea, coffee
and chocolate, and English-made shoes.</p>

<p>The "New York Gazette" of May 15, 1789, describes
a gown of the prevailing mode as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A plain but celestial blue satin gown over a white satin petticoat.
Over the neck was worn a large Italian gauze handkerchief. Head-dress
a pouf of gauze in form of a globe, the head-piece of which
was made of white satin having a double wing which was trimmed
with a wreath of roses. The hair was dressed in detached curls
and a floating chignon."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>At this same period in winter weather the gentlemen
wore muffs of bearskin with knots of scarlet ribbon,
while the hats of the ladies were so immense that it
was suggested that a larger style of umbrella be
invented so as to protect them.</p>

</div>

<p>From 1750 the decoration of the fireplace became of
importance, and marble chimney-fronts, blue and white
tiles, and beautifully variegated marble hearths in different
colours are freely advertised. Carved and open-work
mahogany mantelpieces could be had by 1765,
and elegant grates and Bath Stoves are imported from
England. Fire-dogs or andirons of many patterns are
advertised for sale. In <a href="#Page_128">Figure 57</a>, there
will be seen in the fireplace a pair representing marching
soldiers.</p>

<p>We have seen in many inventories how the elegances
of the East crept in among stouter and more practical
goods. In <a href="#Page_140">Figure 66</a> are shown two fine examples of
Oriental lacquer-work ornamented with gold and inlaid
with mother-of-pearl flowers. The chair is lacquered
on some exceedingly light and porous wood, and has
a cane seat. The table, which is of a very ornate
design, has a heavy base to prevent its tipping over.
Both belong to the Erastus Corning Estate, and are
now at the Albany Historical Society Rooms. Music-stands
were also made of lacquered wood and decorated
with gilt patterns and mother-of-pearl.</p>

<p>Another very beautiful example of lacquer-work is
shown in <a href="#Page_142">Figure 67</a>. This is gold lacquer on black
and special attention should be given to the Oriental
rendering of the pillar and claw feet of the table.
The carving is very fine, the dragon's head in
which each foot terminates being quite a work of art.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
The vase which stands on the table is Sèvres, made
under Napoleon's direction as a gift to the Emperor
of Russia. It never reached its destination; for Napoleon
himself went to Russia, and his mission was not
to give, but to take. The vase was secured in Paris by
Mr. William Bayard, and presented by him to his
brother-in-law, General Stephen Van Rensselaer, the
eighth patroon of Rensselaerwick.</p>

<p>Bureaus with flat tops, upon which stood either
lacquered or wooden dressing-glasses, were in use during
the latter part of the eighteenth and in the early
part of the nineteenth centuries. Sometimes the
glasses were attached to the bureau itself, which then
had an extra set of small drawers above the larger ones,
set back so as to leave a shelf in front of them. Such
a piece of a very ornate character is shown in Figure
68. It is of mahogany with gilt mountings of very
beautiful design on the pillars of the front. The drawer
which swells out has on it a splendid Empire gilt ornament.
Above this the rail across the front is painted
black and has a pattern in gold upon it. The curved
supports to the mirror are carved and then painted
with gold, as is the mirror-frame itself. The handles
are glass, with bosses of gilt, completing an unusually
handsome piece of furniture. The glass handles place
the date of this bureau as not earlier than 1820.</p>

<p>The work of domestic furniture-makers has often
been referred to in this work, and in <a href="#Page_145">Figure 69</a> are
given examples of three chairs, all of them mahogany,
the two on the left being in Sheraton style, and the
one on the right rather later, and coming under the
head of Empire. The latter has the curved back and
legs which were very popular, and a very distinctively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
American touch in the finely carved eagle which ornaments
the cross-bar of the back. All three chairs are
well carved, and the panelled back of the middle one
has a thread of brass moulding. The carved design is
adapted from some well-known patterns by Sheraton.
The one on the extreme left has some very delicate
carving above the three arrows. In the little open
panel are a bow and quiver quite out of proportion, in
their size, to the large, heavy arrows below it. All
three chairs had the covering nailed down with brass
nails in the popular style, and the middle one still has
the original stuff. American cabinet-makers also
excelled in making and carving very beautiful rosewood
furniture which was held in high estimation down to
the middle of the century. A piece of such work is
shown in the handsomely carved card-table represented
in <a href="#Page_146">Figure 70</a>. The legs are gracefully curved and
embellished with fine carving. The top turns, and then
opens, a circular portion of the center being covered
with cloth. Within the frame the table is finished
with handsome curled maple, and has numerous little
compartments for holding cards and counters. This
specimen belongs to Miss Sarah Frost, of Rochester,
N. Y.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br /><small>
FRENCH FURNITURE.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> glory of the French Renaissance had begun to
wane when Louis XIII. came to the throne in 1614,
and by the time of his death in 1643 it had become
hardly more than a tradition. Its strongest period had
been during that century which embraced the reigns of
five sovereigns, Francis I., and II., and Henry II., III.,
and IV. This was from 1515 to 1610, and, of all
monarchs who held the throne of France, Francis I.,
who sat upon it thirty-two years, did more for it in
raising the standard of art than had been done by his
predecessors in a century, though Henry II. and
Henry IV. had made their reigns notable.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig071.jpg" alt="Figure 71. BEDROOM OF ANNE OF AUSTRIA AT FONTAINEBLEAU." width="600" height="463" />
<p class="caption">Figure 71. BEDROOM OF ANNE OF AUSTRIA AT FONTAINEBLEAU.</p>
</div>

<p>Rich, ambitious to have France as great in art as
Italy, Francis was a liberal patron, and invited to
Paris, the centre of all literature and art in France,
painters, sculptors, and architects. Italy had difficulties
to contend with from the fact that she was divided
into many small principalities and dominated by many
schools. Florence, Milan, Sienna, Naples,&mdash;each had
their distinctive styles; but in France the court of
Francis was the pivot upon which all the arts turned.
He built that series of chateaus which remain among
the wonders of the world,&mdash;Chambord, Chenonceau,
and Fontainebleau. He left traces of his taste on mediæval
Amboise, remodelled the Louvre, and finished the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
restoration of Blois which had been begun by Louis
XII. The throes through which France has passed has
swept away some of her choicest historic monuments,
but Fontainebleau remains a true example of French
Renaissance. With this fine old palace are connected
some of the most critical moments of French history.
In one of its rooms was signed the revocation of the
Edict of Nantes; Condé was murdered here in the
library, or Gallery of Diana. On the great curved
staircase Napoleon bade adieu to what remained of
the Old Guard before he went to Elba, and on a little
table in one of the six rooms which might be called
the suite of the First Empire, extending back of the
gallery of Francis I. he signed his act of abdication.</p>

<p>The decorations of this palace are superb, the very
flower of the French Renaissance. Oak, carved and
gilded, wainscots the walls in many of the rooms, but
in the chamber of Anne of Austria, shown in Figure
71, the wainscoting consists of carved panels framed
in marbles, and above them carved figures stand out
from the painted walls, which are divided by oak
mouldings into sections, while a beautiful carved cornice
of scallop-shells on a gold ground surrounds the
room.</p>

<p>The French, as no other nation has ever done, set
in a fitting shrine the beautiful furniture which they
made; the decoration of walls, doors, ceilings, and fireplace
always playing an important part in the whole
scheme. The French "style," a word on which
Lady Dilke strongly insists in her great work on
"French Furniture of the XVIII Century," was unmistakably
impressed on all they attempted. The
woodwork was lighter and more openly carved than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Italian work of the same period. Even when made by
Italian workmen who swarmed to the French court
under promise of abundant employment and rich
emolument, the work was imbued with the French
spirit and an elegance with which even Italy could not
vie.</p>

<p>The noble appreciation which had grown up in
France was fostered by Louis XIV. when he came to
the throne, not so much for art's sake as for his own
aggrandizement, and to make his court the most
elegant in the world. Louis contemned the style of
elegance and luxury begun in an earlier reign, and
artists of even superior merit were set to work to
make beautiful the homes of those uncrowned queens
on whom the "Grand Monarch" lavished such
immense sums of money. Versailles was enriched,
the lovely gardens planned by Le Notre, with their
superb flower beds and fountains, the "green carpet"
of turf down which the monarch loved to walk, were
all made with enormous outlay of money.</p>

<p>The hotels and buildings at Versailles set apart for
the service of the king and his attendants were
numbered by hundreds. There were the royal stables,
the new hotel of the Governor of Versailles, the green
rooms of the actors who performed at the palace, the
hotel of the keeper of the wardrobe, the hotel of the
guardsmen, the English garden, the riding-school, the
king's icehouses, the houses of the body-guard, and
so on. Street after street was filled with these buildings,
besides those devoted to falconry, boar-hunting,
the kennels, the little stables, and those filled with
shops, vegetable gardens, etc., and in addition that
great habitation occupied by more than two thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
persons, with other buildings called "Louises" where
the king assigned temporary or permanent lodgings.
The great stables built in 1682 and costing 3,000,000
francs are some of the few buildings left to show
the magnificence of old Versailles. They were so
ample and beautiful that under the direction of the
great Louis himself they served sometimes as a ball-room,
sometimes as a theatre, and more often as a
circus for the princes.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig072.jpg" alt="Figure 72. BED OF LOUIS XIV AT VERSAILLES." width="600" height="411" />
<p class="caption">Figure 72. BED OF LOUIS XIV AT VERSAILLES.</p>
</div>

<p>There is a bound volume extant, bearing the name
of Mansart, in which the cost of the palace is given at
153,000,000 francs. This was but the casket itself
without any of its furnishings. Louis preferred to
live in the open air, and the gardens were merely outdoor
drawing-rooms, where people conversed and
exchanged the compliments of the day. Round his
person the king loved to group his retinue, and down
the broad staircases of the gardens sixty ladies with
hoopskirts measuring twenty-four feet in circumference
could move easily. On the outskirts were a
swarm of courtiers and servants in uniforms, costumes,
and liveries as brilliant as the rainbow.</p>

<p>Consider the life of one of these courtiers under the
reign of Louis XIV. Here is the routine of the Duc
de La Rochefoucauld, Master of the Hounds:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"He never missed the king's rising or retiring, both changes of
dress every day, the hunts and promenades likewise every day, for
ten years in succession. Never sleeping away from the place
where the king rested, not able to stay away all night, and yet
obliged to dine away from court."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even after the court etiquette became more stiff
and precise, and the formal manners arranged by Louis
and Madame de Maintenon were in daily practice,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the smaller details of life remained as elegant as possible.
Hoopskirts of such size as has been mentioned
were too enormous for chairs, so a sort of stool without
arms or back became a necessary article of furniture.
One sofa, two arm-chairs, and nine stools were
a proper proportion for a set to furnish a room, and
these were stiffly set about the walls, leaving the
middle of the room quite bare.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Page_151">Figure 72</a> is shown part of the bedroom of Louis
XIV. at Versailles, with the elaborate decorations
which were lavished on that palace, and the furniture
which accompanied it. Tapestry-covered chairs and
hangings of the richest embroidery were all in
harmony with the splendid walls. The tall bronze
girandoles were Cupids supporting branches of flowers
in ormolu to hold candles. Over the doors were portraits
or mirrors surmounted by carved and gilt
figures with garlands of flowers. The decorated
Boulle cabinet on the right is very different in its
lines from those articles as seen in the succeeding
reign, when everything assumed a lighter air. The
curtains to the bed could completely enfold it, and to
their sheltering depths the great Louis is said to
have retired before removing his wig.</p>

<p>The chairs shown in <a href="#Page_152">Figure 73</a> are of this period,
the one upon the right retaining its original covering,
the woodwork being carved and gilt. The cane chair
on the left is of walnut, and the one in the centre,
carved and gilt, is a French adaptation of a Flemish
design.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Figure 73.  CHAIRS OF THE PERIOD OF LOUIS XIV.</p>
</div>

<p>It is difficult to re-people one of these splendid
rooms and consider a period when, as M. Taine says,
"life was wholly operatic." The grandee lived in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
state of luxury and grandeur. His trappings were as
magnificent as he could make them, and his household
was filled with military as well as civil appointments,
approaching as nearly to that of the king as possible.</p>

<p>The king must have a stable, so at Versailles were
1,875 horses, 217 vehicles, and 1,458 men who were
clothed in liveries costing 540,000 francs a year.
This is but a single item in the great total considered
under fifty or sixty heads. To wait on the king himself,
198 persons were required; some fetched his
mall and balls; some combed his hair; others watched
his dogs; and there were those who tied his necktie
after it had been properly folded. Some there were
whose sole business it was to stand in a corner which
was not to be left empty.</p>

<p>The policy which prescribed the custom at court
was all for ostentatious display. St. Simon says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"He (Louis XIV.) was pleased to see a display of dress, table,
equipages, buildings, and play; these afforded him opportunities for
entering into conversation with people. The contagion had spread
from the court into the provinces and to the armies, where people
of any position were esteemed only according to their table and
magnificence."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Louis had so dominated the whole court life that
he had brought his courtiers to believe that the main
thing in life for layman and churchman, and for women
and men alike, was to be at all hours and in every
place under the king's eye and within reach of his
voice.</p>

<p>With all this army of personal attendants to feed,
clothe, and shelter, the repairs to houses and furniture
represented immense sums yearly, and many establishments
were taken under royal patronage in order to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
command their products and to reduce the expenditures.</p>

<p>The history of French furniture is quite closely
connected with the history of tapestry, for after a
time it was used as a covering. Francis I., who appreciated
the value of this textile as an ornament as well
as a covering for his walls, and unwilling to buy all
his pieces from the skilful looms of Flanders, started
a factory in 1531 at Fontainebleau. In 1603 a new
factory was started at Paris, under royal patronage, in
the workshop of a family of dyers named Gobelin.
The first workers were Flemish weavers who were
brought over to teach the craft to Frenchmen. Louis
XIV. protected the factory through the mediumship
of that great financier, Colbert, who appointed Le
Brun, the artist, director of the works. In 1667 the
factory became the property of the Crown, and most
artistic and elegant productions were made.</p>

<p>Not only in France did the Gobelins find patronage,
but in England as well their work was in great
demand. Evelyn writes in the last years of the reign
of Charles II.:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"Here I saw the new fabriq of French tapisstry; for designe,
tendernesse of worke, and incomparable imitationn of the best
paintings beyond anything I ever beheld. Some pieces had Versailles,
St. Germain's, and other palaces of the French King, with
huntings, figures, and landskips, exotiq fowls, and all to the life
rarely don."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The golden age of Louis XIV. saw also the golden
age of tapestry, for it was during his reign that the
proud and royal factory at Aubusson was at its highest
estate. The tapestries sent out from this factory
were not mere imitations as close as possible of painted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
pictures. The limitations of the process were ever
considered, and the number of gradations in every
tint was limited so that the dangers of unequal fading
reached their lowest point. The beautiful borders
which surrounded the central picture were designed
and executed with the same care that was bestowed
on the centre, and formed a part of the whole that
could ill be spared.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig074.jpg" alt="Figure 74. TAPESTRY FURNITURE." width="441" height="600" />
<p class="caption">Figure 74. TAPESTRY FURNITURE.</p>
</div>

<p>The tapestries worked late in the seventeenth century
and early in the eighteenth, before the spirit of
commercialism had been suffered to encroach on what
up to that time had been carefully fostered art work,
were all examples of great beauty and merit. In
1694, Louis having lost interest in the manufactory,
and Colbert and Le Brun being dead, the works at
the Gobelins' factories declined, and they became
financially embarrassed. Still the great name was in
high esteem, and its more than national reputation
was retained. The splendid works which had been
sent out from the loom, "The Triumph of Alexander,"
"The History of the King," "The Elements," and
"The Seasons," were no longer in demand. Fontaine's
fables and "The Adventures of Don Quixote"
took the place of the more dignified designs, and at
last sets of chair-backs and sofa covers were woven
where previously historic subjects of heroic size had
been demanded. Every year there were "<i>Chancelleries</i>"
made,&mdash;series of hangings adorned with the royal arms,
which the king gave to his chancellors.</p>

<p>"The Adventures of Don Quixote" consisted of a
set of from twenty to twenty-eight pieces, and so
pleased the public taste that sets were being continually
woven from 1723 till the times of the Revolution.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
They were varied by the different colours of
the background, and also by having different borders,
some of them designed by artists like Lemaire the
younger, and of great beauty. By 1736 the manufactory
once more received assistance and patronage from
the Crown, and famous old models were renewed, and
two new sets, from "The Story of Esther," and "The
Story of Medea and Jason," were designed. About
the middle of the century came the fatal desire to
copy paintings as they came from the hand of the
artist, and the traditions which had governed the labor
of the tapestry-worker for centuries were thrown aside.
In vain the workmen protested: good taste and the
principles of decoration were sacrificed, and the artist
triumphed. The only check to the artist's exactions
was the immense cost of production, for the painter
was totally ignorant of the practical difficulties which
had to be overcome in carrying out his designs; and
as the tapestry-workers were paid by the piece they
could no longer calculate or limit the cost of execution.</p>

<p>The Beauvais tapestries were long granted superior
excellence in flower forms, trees, etc., and for figures
also, and they held to the styles in which they excelled.
But the Gobelins after 1740 no longer did work
which was not fashionable and profitable. In 1755
Boucher, the well-known artist, was appointed director
of the Gobelins, and, like his predecessors, believed in
simulating, as far as possible the painter's art. There
is tragedy in the history of the devoted band of
workers who, ill-paid, and not sufficiently recognized,
laboured at the looms and in the dye-house
to carry out the artist's ideas. One of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Quimiset, a chemist of undoubted ability, committed
suicide. Neilson and Audran were both ruined financially;
and yet these servants of the crown were not
allowed to leave Paris to better their fortunes.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig075.jpg" alt="Figure 75. COMMODES OF THE TIME OF LOUIS XV." width="287" height="600" />
<p class="caption">Figure 75. COMMODES OF THE TIME OF LOUIS XV.</p>
</div>

<p>The Gobelins began to produce tapestry for furniture
only during the last half of the eighteenth century.
This work was undertaken in hopes of financial
profit, for the competition of woven and embroidered
stuffs from England, as well as the novelty of English
paper-hangings, had crippled them excessively. The
very first pieces made were for four chairs and a sofa,
in 1748. These furniture tapestries became immediately
popular. Screens, seat, sofa and chair backs,
showing scenes, figures, ribbon-work, and garlands
brought up the failing fortune of Gobelin and made
Beauvais wealthy. From this latter factory came
those coverings, with designs after Boucher, set in
wooden frames of the richest carving and gilt.</p>

<p>The cost of these works was as great as brocade
and velvet, and crowded out the embroiderers, who in
turn aimed, with the means at their command, to rival
the efforts of the tapestry-workers. Then came that
most sumptuous combination of painting with embroidery,
and in 1743 the Duc de Luynes describes a
new set of furniture for the queen's bedroom.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It is of white gros de Tours, embroidered and painted, and is
quite complete, consisting of the bed, its hangings, the fauteuils,
and curtains."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During the Revolution, in 1793, a bonfire was made
in the courtyard of the Gobelin factory, and a set of
hangings with designs of "The Visit of Louis XIV. to
the Gobelins," several <i>portieres</i>, and a set of "<i>Chancelleries</i>"
were burned. On another visit the cartoons of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Raphael were destroyed, those of "Esther" and
"Medea" thrown out, and everything with a tendency
toward aristocracy discarded.</p>

<p>The terms "Beauvais," "Aubusson," etc., do not give
their names to any particular style of tapestry. The
various factories wove according to their requirements,
and used silk, woolen, silver and gold thread as the
design called for it. In <a href="#Page_155">Figure 74</a> are given examples
of work from these famous establishments. The
Louis XIV. screen is a silk panel, the pattern being
Flora, surrounded by Cupids and wreaths and garlands
of flowers. The design is by Berain, and was made at
the Gobelins; the frame is richly carved and gilt.</p>

<p>The Louis XVI. chair is covered with Beauvais
tapestry&mdash;baskets of flowers and scrolls. The lovely
tints are hardly faded, or they have so faded in harmony
that it resembles the changing hues of mother-of-pearl.
The wooden frame is carved and gilded, a
fit setting for the beautiful tapestry. The sofa and
chair are but two of a set, the other pieces being nine
more chairs. These are of the Louis XIV. period
and are covered with Aubusson tapestry,&mdash;crimson
peonies on a pale-green ground. The bow leg and
carved knees are similar to those shown in <a href="#Page_152">Figure 73</a>,
and, like the one on the right in that illustration are
gilded. At a recent sale held in Paris, when the great
collection of Madame Lelong was dispersed, the prices
obtained for these old tapestries, whether wall-coverings
or on furniture, were absolutely astonishing. A
screen with four panels of Beauvais tapestry illustrating
La Fontaine's fables brought $3,700. One seat,
of carved and gilded wood, covered with a piece of
Beauvais, brought $2,000, and four chairs in carved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
and gilded wood with Beauvais tapestry coverings
brought $41,000. These prices, while sensational,
give some idea of the esteem in which these antiques
are held. The tapestry covered pieces shown belong
to the Waring Galleries, London.</p>

<p>The best-known name of any one man who worked
in furniture during the splendid reign of Louis XIV.
was of André-Charles Boulle, b. 1642, d. 1732. The
superb marquetry work he made, composed of brass,
ivory, tortoise-shell, gold, and a choice selection of
woods from India, Brazil, and other tropical countries,
took the fancy of the king by reason of its sumptuous
nature. Boulle was given an apartment in the Louvre
and for his great master the celebrated <i>ébéniste</i> composed
his choicest work. A cabinet of this work can
be seen in <a href="#Page_151">Figure 72</a> to the right of the bed.</p>

<p>In 1672 Louis XIV. had made Boulle engraver-in-ordinary
of the royal seals. The patent conferring
this appointment calls Boulle "architect, painter,
carver in mosaic, artist in cabinet work, chaser, inlayer,
and designer of figures." The most important works
of Boulle which records show were at Versailles, like
those he executed for foreign princes, have disappeared.
His workshops and studios were of vast
extent; he employed many workmen, and consulted
for his models a priceless collections of drawings,
medals, and gems, comprising drawings by Raphael,
and that "manuscript journal kept by Rubens during
his travels in Italy and elsewhere, which contained his
notes and studies in painting and sculpture, copiously
illustrated by pen-and-ink sketches."</p>

<p>In "French Furniture of the XVIII Century," by
Lady Dilke, this priceless collection belonging to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
Boulle is described at length, and also the immense
loss to which this worker was subjected when, in
1720, his entire warehouses and shops were burned
down. Boulle was an old man at this time, and for
the rest of his life ill-fortune followed him, and he died
wretchedly poor, leaving nothing but debts which for
years he had been forced to put off by every variety
of makeshift. His four sons, one of whom bore his
father's name, never accomplished works of such elegance
and solidity as those of their father. They, too,
had endless misfortune, were ejected from the apartment
in the Louvre which had descended to them
from their father, and died, as he did, in poverty and
misery.</p>

<p>Yet the splendid and showy style of furniture to
which Boulle gave his name remained in fashion and
was made during the whole of the eighteenth century.
After the death of the younger Boulles, pupils who
had studied with their father and themselves carried
on the work, and of course there were imitators as
well. Boulle did not invent this style of decoration,
for ebony cabinets ornamented with tortoise-shell and
copper were known in France long before Boulle was
born. He simply perfected the method of making it.
Nor did he confine himself to this particular style of
marquetry, for he made works, mentioned in his catalogue,
of wood inlaid with other woods of various colours
and ornamented with bronze mounts.</p>

</div>

<p>Under the Regency, fashions changed, not only in
manners and clothes, but even in furniture and belongings
as well, though this latter change came slowly.
The Duc d'Orleans and his daughter, the Duchesse de
Berri, conducted entertainments of so scandalous a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
nature that even the French public was horrified; and
gaming, which under Louis XIV. had risen to prodigious
extremes, became more furious still, and, possessing
all classes of society, spread ruin everywhere.
The use of looking-glasses for ornaments had become
very much the vogue during the period of Louis XIV.'s
reign. They were introduced into walls opposite windows,
and in places where reflection would carry out
the idea of windows. The court beauties, both male
and female, had the walls of their bathrooms lined with
them, and the frames in which they were set were
lavishly carved and gilded.</p>

<p>While Boulle's is associated with the reign of Louis
XIV., with the Regency the name of Charles Cressent
rose to eminence. His work was much like that of
Boulle in character, but he gradually gave more importance
to the mounts of metal as a means of ornament,
and used less marquetry. He not only used floral
forms for these metal decorations, but modelled beautiful
little groups of Cupids or Loves with garlands
and roses, and these ornaments were applied directly
to the rosewood frames of wardrobe or cabinet, whichever
was chosen for such embellishment. Nor was
he content with such charming subjects only, for he
modelled children swinging a monkey, or monkeys
swinging themselves, or dancing a tight rope, and
invested even these grotesques with style and charm.</p>

<p>With the reign of Louis XV. even more sumptuous
surroundings were desired. At Fontainebleau the
luxury was unparalleled, and when the king held a
reception, at which there were both cards and dancing,
the spectacle, according to records left in the copious
memoirs of the times, was one of sumptuous elegance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Four or five hundred guests surrounded the tables
where cards and cavagnole were played. Hanging
from the ceiling painted with Cupids garlanded with
flowers, were many blazing chandeliers, their brilliancy
reflected a thousand times in the tall mirrors. Everything
was flooded with light,&mdash;the painted walls, the
rich gilding, the diamonds sparkling on white necks
and in the hair of the women, whose dresses gleamed
with gold, silver, pearls, and artificial flowers and
fruits, all in the most gorgeous hues. The men were
almost as gay. Their hair was powdered, curled, and
dressed. Their coats of sky-blue, rose, peach, pearl
or puce-colored satin, velvet, or brocade, were embroidered
with silks and gold, and ornamented with ruffles
and cravats of lace. The dress of a man, with his
jewelled sword, shoulder-knots with diamond tags, and
buckles of brilliants on shoe and knee, might have
cost a small fortune. Gold and silver thread made
stiff and costly, stuffs already rich in themselves, while
the money lavished on lace had no limit.</p>

<p>When a princess of France married it was no uncommon
thing for the laces on her bedspreads and
linens to reach the sum of $100,000. The frills on her
personal linen added $25,000 more. The ruffle on a
handkerchief was cheap at $50, and a laced nightcap
might easily double that. All this elaboration of elegance
had fitting surroundings, and the case was
worthy of its contents.</p>

</div>

<p>Like his predecessor, Louis XV. lavished vast sums on buildings, and
Madame de Pompadour, an uncrowned queen, spent millions more. The
Hotel d'Evreux, begun in 1718, was many years later finished under her
personal direction. She had the virtue of being a liberal patron of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>

the arts and an encourager of artistic merit wherever she found it. Her
taste, her sincere love for art, enabled her at least to secure works
of absolute perfection, and during the twenty years of her reign it was
mainly her fostering guidance which developed so many of the applied
arts. She not only assumed the direction of work at her chateaus and
hotels, but she encouraged the manufactory of the beautiful porcelain
of Sèvres; she assisted engravers, and essayed to learn the art
herself; and by taste, natural and acquired, she was looked upon by the
group of artists of her time as a final court of appeal in all critical
matters.</p>

<p>Her successors were no less extravagant, but they
lacked her exquisite and artistic judgment, which
amounted almost to genius. It was during this
period of Louis XV. that the evolution of chests of
drawers, writing-tables, and cabinets&mdash;that is chests
upon trestle-work&mdash;was accomplished. The ornament
changed constantly, but the form of the articles
remained much the same. The changes wrought in
Paris affected the country slowly, and provincial artists
working at the period of Louis XV. might have been
using the models that had been popular in a previous
reign. In <a href="#Page_157">Figure 75</a> are depicted rosewood commodes
with curved fronts and ends, handsomely decorated
with ormulu work in leaves and scrolls. A French
clock of the period, with ormolu mounts, stands on the
marble top of one, and on the other is one of black
and gold lacquer, with very choice water-gilt mounts.</p>

<p>In this period the names of the Caffieri, father and
two sons, who were workers in metal, became famous.
They executed bronze mounts for furniture like those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
on the commodes shown in <a href="#Page_157">Figure 75</a>, a style which
they may be said to have created and by their genius
rendered popular. The mounting on these pieces is
very simple, and takes the subservient place that ornament
always should. But in some of the work executed
by the Caffieri the wood became merely the
vehicle on which a wealth of ornament was hung.
They made not only mounts for furniture, but girandoles,
branch-lights, mounts for vases and clocks, and
chandeliers&mdash;working in bronze and silver as well as in
brass. This taste for metal mounts was carried to an
extreme, even pieces of richly carved furniture being
further ornamented with chiselled brass. It is an item
of interest that the monument to General Montgomery
which is placed on that side of St. Paul's Chapel,
New York city, which faces Broadway, should have
been designed and executed by Caffier in Paris
in 1777. The General was buried first in Quebec,
and afterward removed to New York by act of Congress.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Page_159">Figure 76</a> is given what is called a <i>garderobe</i>,
that is wardrobe, with a basket of flowers at the top,
this and the two bunches of flowers at the tops of the
doors being in ormolu.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>Even as early as the middle of the previous century
there had been imitators of the splendid lacquer-work
of the Orient. By 1723 the three Martin Brothers,
Julien, Robert, and Simon-Etienne, had become quite
famous for their use of a transparent varnish, which,
as "master painters and varnishers," they had perfected
in their business. They pushed their trade, and
by 1748 were under national protection, so popular had
their wares become. In 1742 they perfected a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
green varnish which was immensely popular, and for
which they had many orders, some of them from the
king himself. They never excelled as painters, but
the beauty of this famous green ground, powdered
with gold, is very charming. Very little of this famous
work remains, a few fire-screens and some splendid
coaches, with some small boxes for snuff or patches,
are all that exist. But in these small pieces like the
boxes, which were considered worthy of gold and
jewelled mounts, we can see this famous work to the
best advantage. There were ribbings, stripings,
waves, and flecks which gleam wonderfully through the
varnish. Sometimes there are a few flowers or a Cupid
scattered on the surface, but usually, when the green
ground was employed, no decoration was considered
necessary. With the death of Robert Martin in 1765
the skill necessary to continue this work was lost, and
this charming style of decoration dropped back merely
to a trade, and "Vernis-Martin" became hardly
more than a name.</p>

<p>Among the other great workers of this period were
Oeben, whose marquetry in coloured woods was of
extreme elegance, and Riesener, who began to execute
his beautiful pieces of furniture under Louis XV.
in what is known as his earlier style, but who finally
created the straight-legged types of Louis XVI. style
with which his name became associated. In the work
which he did for Marie Antoinette at the Little Trianon
in 1777, the pure Louis XVI. style is carried out.
The earlier pieces, delivered as early as 1771, still
betray the influence of a previous period.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Page_160">Figure 77</a> is shown the bedroom of Marie Antoinette
at the Little Trianon. Here we see the later
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
style set by Riesener, with the straight carved legs,
the woodwork being painted and gilded. The silk
factories at Lyons were no longer as well patronized
as they had been, and to revive interest in them new
furniture was ordered for the queen, to be upholstered
in brocade, and with curtains and hangings to match.
Everything in these rooms breathes of dainty elegance,&mdash;the
carvings of the mantelpiece, the walls
decorated with garlands of flowers and Cupids, even
the metal mounts, chiselled wreaths and rosettes, were
wrought with the beauty and finish of goldsmith's
work. In the small chair by the bedside is seen a style
with gilt framework and embroidered cushions, a kind
of covering which was always in demand.</p>

<p>In 1770 two coaches were sent to Vienna for Marie
Antoinette. The work of the embroiderer was selected
to embellish their interiors, and the description of
them is given by Bachaumont:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"They were two berlins, much larger than usual, but yet not
so large as those of the king. One is lined with rose velvet and
the Four Seasons are embroidered on the largest cushions, with
all the attributes of a festival. The other is lined with blue velvet,
and on the cushions of this are worked the Four Elements. There
is not a touch of painting about them, but the work of the artist
is so perfect and finished that each one is a complete work of art."</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">Figure 80. BED OF JOSEPHINE AT FONTAINEBLEAU.</p>
</div>

<p>The name of the embroider was Treaumau, and so
celebrated did the beauty of these royal cushions make
him that he received large orders, the most important
being one from Madam de Berri for a <i>vis-à-vis</i>. The
two berlins for Marie Antoinette were placed on exhibition
before they were sent to her, and constituted
an event of the day.</p>

<p>The three pieces shown in <a href="#Page_162">Figure 78</a> are pure types
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
of Louis XVI. style. They are at the Cooper Institute,
New York. The chair on the right has its original
embroidered cover, and the straight carved leg so much
in evidence. All three pieces are entirely gilt wherever
the woodwork shows. The top of the table is
marble. The chair to the left is very prettily carved
with a torch and bow and arrows, according to the conceit
of the times, when everything was to be joyous
and gay, all suffering and sorrow being resolutely
thrust out of sight. Rose, blue, and gold were the
colours affected, nothing sombre being allowed. The
whole life was careless and without responsibility. The
letters of the day, Saint-Beuve, Comte de Tilly, Duc
de Lauzun, and Madam d' Oberkirk, draw graphic
pictures of the life of pleasure. The Duc de Lauzun
says that one of his mother's lackeys, who could read
and write tolerably well, was made his tutor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"They gave me the most fashionable teachers besides, but M.
Roche (the tutor) was not qualified to arrange their lessons, nor to
qualify me to benefit by them. I was, moreover, like all the children
of my age and station, dressed in the handsomest clothes to go
out, and naked and dying with hunger in the house."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was not through unkindness, but because of
dissipation and carelessness, all the time and attention
being given elsewhere. Even in the last days of the
<i>ancien régime</i> little boys had their hair powdered and
dressed in ringlets and curls. They wore a sword,
carried a chapeau under the arm, wore laces and frills,
and coats with cuffs heavy with gold lace. The small
girls were their mothers in miniature. At six one of
them would present her hand for a little dandy to kiss,
her little figure would be squeezed into a stiff corset,
her huge hoop-skirt supported a skirt of brocade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
enwreathed with garlands of flowers. On her head
was a structure of false curls, puffs, knots, and ribbons,
held on by pins and topped with plumes; and if she
was pale they would put rouge on her face. By force
of habit and instruction she bore herself like a mature
woman. Her most important instructor was the
dancing-master, her never-ending study deportment.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century drawing-room women
were queens. They prescribed the law and fashion in
all things. There was no situation, however delicate,
that they did not save through tact and politeness.
This was the time when first Watteau, and later Lancret
and Fragonard, painted the <i>Fêtes galantes</i>, when
pretty picnics and dancing in a woody dell were
great diversions. It was an idealized life of the brilliant
world of France which early in the eighteenth
century Watteau painted. Scattered all through the
land were sumptuous dwellings of the rich, upon
which fortunes were lavished. Beaus and belles alike
dressed themselves <i>à la Watteau</i>. He became the
lover's poet, a painter of an ideal pastoral which hardly
existed, but to which his hand gave beauty and value.
This was one side. On the other, besides heavy taxation,
poor crops, flood, famine, and the devastation of
war, there was always the pest. This terrible contagious
fever, with the smallpox, was a scourge to the
people. Hundreds fell victims to these twin plagues,
for the usual treatment was copious bleeding.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig081.jpg" alt="Figure 81. BED OF NAPOLEON AT GRAND TRIANON." width="600" height="371" />
<p class="caption">Figure 81. BED OF NAPOLEON AT GRAND TRIANON.</p>
</div>

<p>But the court, while it might suffer at times from
sickness and death, never allowed itself to think of
such things. It amused itself with balls and masques,
plays, and even with blindman's-buff. The gardens
at Versailles were always in gala dress, and at night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
musicians played among the trees, and thousands of
lights sparkled among the flowers. Fifty years later
they played at simplicity too, these great ladies and
elegant cavaliers, laying aside the silks and brocades
of which a surfeit had wearied them, and wearing
picturesque gowns of simple material and cut. Marie
Antoinette herself set the example in her retreat at
Little Trianon, with the muslin gown and fichu
crowned with a straw hat, in which she ran across the
gardens. Beneath all this elegance, amiability, and
extravagance the Revolution seethed and boiled and
finally overran and destroyed. Till almost the very
end extravagance increased, and in <a href="#Page_164">Figure 79</a> is shown
an encoignure, or corner cupboard with commode below,
and cabinet above, of the most elaborate inlaid
work, with very rich ormolu mounts. This work is by
David de Luneville, and is a marvel of the intricacy of
inlaying, many different woods being used in that jumble
of ornament which forms the decoration of the
door in the cabinet. At each intersection of the lattice
work inlay is a little rosette. The divisions of the lower
part have an edging of satin-wood, which in the centre
panel is made more ornate with an inlay of ebony.
This piece is at the Waring Galleries, London.</p>

<p>The new conditions in France wrought changes in
every detail of life. Simplicity, so called, was becoming
the watchword, and once more antique models
were sought for forms and decorations. Under the
Empire the style was much less graceful, the lines
coarser, and the elaboration of ornament heavy.
Could anything be less pleasing than Josephine's bed
at Fontainebleau, shown in <a href="#Page_166">Figure 80</a>? It is one of
the few unsightly things in that beautiful palace, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
are now gathered so many works of art. The bedstead
is covered with heavy chiselled ornaments in brass,
and surmounted by a canopy held on pillars. This
canopy is partly of carved wood and partly of embroidered
satin. There are strings of gold beads hanging
from this satin, and in addition heavy satin curtains
very richly embroidered. These are edged with a long
and clumsy fringe. The whole room is in keeping
with the bed, for the floor is covered with a carpet
bearing the imperial insignia all over it, and the hangings
on the walls have countless spots in lieu of a
pattern. It was at Fontainebleau that the sentence
of divorce was passed on Josephine, and it seems
possible that the sleepless nights which the poor lady
endured must have been rendered more miserable by
the unlovely character of her surroundings.</p>

<p>It is with pleasure that one turns to <a href="#Page_168">Figure 81</a>,
showing the bed of the great Emperor himself, at
Grand Trianon, Versailles. It is a good example of the
best Empire work, and is mahogany ornamented with
ormolu mounts in classic style.</p>

</div>

<p>It was now the fashion to decry the furniture or
costumes which had prevailed during the latter half of
the eighteenth century, and to seek the Athenian
models for gowns and furniture. Nor were these
models used in their simple shapes, but transformed
into quite other guise by the touch of French hands.
Marquetry was no longer considered good taste, and
David the painter was largely responsible for much
of the theatrical effect which was noted both in costume
and household belongings. After the fall of the
monarchy, sales had been held, and what had not been
destroyed had been sold. It was now necessary to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
fill again the palaces that had been denuded, and
Percier, the architect, and Joseph Desmalter, the
cabinet-maker, were the men chosen to do it. Desmalter
is responsible for the use of mahogany commodes
embellished with bronze and gilt like those
which flank the bed in <a href="#Page_168">Figure 81</a>. After the expedition
to Egypt, Sphynx figures were introduced in
bronze or brass to uphold tables and as arms for chairs.
These, however, did not become popular, and soon
were replaced by classic heads.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Page_170">Figure 82</a> is shown a room in Fontainebleau furnished
in Empire style. The imperial N may be seen
on the corners of the console tables and on the commode.
The walls are covered with damask woven in
geometric forms, and the rooms once so light and
brilliant with their dainty arabesques and flowers,
Cupids and birds on the ceilings, are now dark and
severe. The splendid chandelier of Venetian glass is
the sole reminder of a previous reign. The only piece
of furniture in the room which is absolutely plain is
the small mahogany table in the foreground. Upon
this Napoleon signed his abdication. In one of the
rooms adjoining the leave-taking between Josephine
and Napoleon occurred, after which he went to St.
Cloud and she to Malmaison.</p>

<p>The commode shows as well as anything the marked
change which took place in the styles under the
Empire. The graceful curves of front and sides are
gone; the feet are stumpy, and so short that the
pleasing proportion between the parts is quite lost.
The constant repetition of the laurel-wreath on chairs,
walls, mantelpieces and furniture is very monotonous,
and we miss the graceful curves of the acanthus and
celery leaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>In <a href="#Page_172">Figure 83</a> is a mahogany reading and writing
desk combined. The brass ornaments are beautifully
chiselled, and, though some are lost, enough remain
to show what a splendid piece of furniture it once
was. They partake, in their delicacy, of the metal
work of the previous century, particularly the escutcheons
and the groups of flowers and musical instruments
which are on the tops of the side pillars. The
desk top lifts up, and inside there are pigeon-holes
and drawers finished in satin-wood. The hole in the
rail above the doors is not a keyhole, but in it fits a
handle by which the whole upper part of the desk is
raised on an iron rod so as to suit the height of who-ever
uses it. This piece is at the Museum of the
Cooper Institute. The rage for furniture in Empire
style was not confined to France alone, but crossed
the channel to England, where it became even less
attractive, and was also used by our own cabinet-makers,
as has been shown in previous chapters.</p>

<p>The changes in the styles of French furniture, like
those which took place in England in the same century
(the eighteenth), were not any more definitely
marked. One period overlapped another, certain
characteristics were retained and put to new uses, so
that a perfect style was arrived at only after years of
growth.</p>

<p>With the name of Louis XIV. is associated the
furniture of Boulle, with its wealth of wonderful inlay.
The metal mount in its most correct and elegant
form marks the period of Louis XV. The reign of
Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette shows the change
from the graceful curves of leg and construction lines
to straight lines and less generous proportions, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
the use of the metal mount is brought to the greatest
extreme. The beauty of form taken from leaf and
shell, wrought in metal and placed on the lines of fine
construction which had marked the epoch of Louis
XV., ran wild under the workers in the next era, and
the fancy for overlaying with costly ornament blinded
the eyes to the poor shapes employed, which were inspired
by a search among classic forms. Even the severest
form may become vulgar when overloaded with
ornament, and with the reign of Louis XV. passed the
production of some of the finest furniture ever made.
What was poor under Louis XVI. became poorer yet
under the Napoleonic era, and the men employed,
instead of drawing from the choice models which still
remained, still farther debased what in previous times
had risen to the dignity of high art.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<small>MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> evolution of the piano from the clavichord
occupied the attention of musicians for over three
hundred years, or from 1404, when the earliest record
occurs, to 1720, when Cristofori's piano was completed
in Florence. The next instrument in the upward
development after the clavichord was the virginal, a
parallelogram in shape, with a projecting keyboard.
Then came the spinet. The earliest of these now in
existence is in Paris, and was made at Verona in 1523.
By 1703 two Englishmen, Thomas and John Hitchcock,
father and son, had made a great advance in the
construction of spinets, giving them a wide compass of
five octavos from G to G.</p>

<p>It was not until about 1660, after the restoration of
the Stuarts, that the name "harpsichord" was given
to the long wing-shaped instrument, similar to our grand
piano, which had hitherto been called <i>clavecembalo</i> in
Italy, <i>flügel</i> in Germany, and <i>clavecin</i> in France.
Early in the sixteenth century the progressive Dutch
had put into use double keyboards and stops. These
were imported into England, and to John Haward is
due the credit for the idea of pedals for the harpsichord.
This was in 1676. This Haward was a
fashionable instrument-maker in the days of the lively
Pepys, who mentions him several times. Thus in
April, 1668, he records:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"Took Aldgate Street in my way, and then did call upon one
Haward, who makes virginals, and there did like of a little
espinette, and will have him finish it for me; for I had a mind to
a small harpsicon, but this takes up less room."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The little espinette took some time to finish; for in
July he says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"while I to buy my espinette, which I did now agree for, and
did at Haward's meet with Mr. Thacker, and heard him play on
the harpsicon so as I never heard man before, I think."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the 15th of July the bargain is concluded; for he
states, under that date:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"At noon is brought home the espinette I bought the other day
of Haward; cost me £5."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few days later he combines business with pleasure,
for he notes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"To buy a rest for my espinette at the ironmonger's by Holborn
Conduit, where the fair pretty woman is, that I have lately observed
there."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#Page_178">Figure 85</a> shows a very beautiful spinet made by
Domenico di Pesaro, in Italy, in 1661. The instrument
can be taken from its outer case, is of cedar
wood, has a projecting keyboard, and is decorated with
ivory studs. The outer case is very handsome, decorated
with <i>gesso</i> work, (which was so much copied by Robert
Adam after his return from Italy) this work being
gold on a pale-green ground. The decoration on the
inside of the cover is a boating scene, the keys are
of light wood, the sharps being black. The instrument,
triangular in shape, rests on three richly carved
and gilt legs, and is four feet eight inches long, by
nineteen inches wide. It looks very tiny, even beside
a "baby grand."</p>

<p>The beauty and enrichment of the cases in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
these instruments were placed shows with what care
and reverence they were regarded. Harpsichords
varied much in having one, two, or occasionally three
banks of keys, and being placed in upright cases, the
covers of which opened like a bookcase, or in a horizontal
case, as in the one shown in <a href="#Page_181">Figure 86</a>. Each
of the three banks of keys has a compass of five octaves,
from F to F. The entire case is gilt Louis XV. style,
decorated with elaborate carvings and with paintings
of flowers and figures in medallions and borders. On
the outside of the cover is the coat of arms of the
Strozzi family. The name of the maker is engraved
on an ivory plate above the keyboards, and reads&mdash;</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Vicentius Sodi Florentius Fecit. Anno Domini 1779.</span></p>
<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>The length of the case is seven feet; it is three feet
wide, and nearly ten inches deep.</p>

<p>The harpsichord held its own for fifty years after
the invention of the pianoforte, for Bartolommeo
Cristofori published his invention as early as 1711,
although he did not perfect his piano till 1720. His
action has the escapement, without which there can
be no vibrating note, and the "check," which was an
all-important step toward repeating notes. There are
preserved at Potsdam, Germany, three pianos which
belonged to Frederick the Great, and which were
made by Silberman, who exactly copied the action as
well as the structure of Cristofori's invention. In
<a href="#Page_182">Figure 87</a> is shown the first piano made by Cristofori.
Above the front board is the following inscription:</p>

belong to the collection of musical instruments given

<p>This crude instrument bears testimony to years of
patient endeavour. Like so many old and valuable
treasures this one was harboured many years for sentimental
reasons only, and because it had been given to
an only daughter by her father. The story of the discovery
of its value came about as follows, as told in a
letter by Signor Martelli, to whose mother the piano
belonged.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"For the sake of economy during the time that Florence was the
capital of Italy, we rented the first floor of our house, No. 3, Via
del Melarancio, and occupied the second floor. In 1872 Signora
Martelli (my mother) again changed her apartments from the second
to the first floor, and at the moment the transfer of our furniture
was taking place from one floor to the other, Prof. Cosimo
Conti, a scholar and intimate friend of ours, came to visit us. The
professor, who was in close correspondence with Cavaliere L. Puliti,
who was spending a great deal of his time in trying to discover
the origin of the piano, discovered on it to his great surprise an
inscription which attested that it had been made by Bartolomeo
Christofori. He immediately informed Cavaliere L. Puliti of this
fact, and he came at once to examine it. Then it was ascertained
that it was one of the rarest and most valuable pianos in existence.
We sent at once for a tuner and had it put into good condition."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The piano was bought by Signora Martelli's father,
about 1819, from the Grand Ducal Palace at Siena, at
an auction sale, held by order of the Minister of the
Household, of all such things as he considered worthless
and of no use. The piano was shuffled out of the
Ducal Palace, much as some of our interesting relics
have been shuffled out of the White House, and offered
at auction.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The Christofori piano has a case of cedar, which is
painted black on the outside. It stands on three
clumsy turned legs. The keys are light-wood naturals
and black sharps. The ivory knobs on the side blocks
may be withdrawn, and the action removed from the
case. There are two strings to each note, and the
length of the instrument is seven feet seven and a
half inches. It is three feet three inches wide at the
front and nine and a half inches deep.</p>

<p>Keyed instruments at first found little favor in the
ears of the Italians, who much preferred the violin with
its "singing voice" and its superior capacity for expression.
Yet they contributed much to the early history
of this branch of the art, though the Germans cultivated
more highly these instruments, which were, in
their first state, very defective in producing melody.
It was Domenico Scarlatti who laid the foundation of
modern music for keyed instruments, and his music for
the harpsichord was not confined to fugues and fantasias,
as was most of the harpsichord music of early
times. The real centre, however, in the line of progress
for music for this instrument proved to be Germany,
and Graun, Hasse, and John Christian Bach all
wrote for the harpsichord.</p>

<p>In America some of the first instruments to come
into use were small organs. They are mentioned as
early as 1711. Although large church organs, with
three rows of keys and pedals, were in use in Europe
by the opening of the sixteenth century, it was long
before they were found here.</p>

<p>The rivalry which church music seems to inspire in
the breasts of those who render it has long existed,
and extends even to those who make the instruments.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
The following story from "Hawkin's History of Music"
bears out this statement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Bernard Smith, or more properly Schmidt, a native of Germany,
came to England with his nephews Gerard and Bernard, and to
distinguish him from them obtained the name of 'Father Smith.'
He was the rival of Harris from France and built an organ at
Whitehall too precipitately, to gain the start of them, as they had
arrived nearly at the same time in England. Emulation was powerfully
exerted. Dallans joined Smith, but died in 1672, and
Renatus Harris, son of the elder Harris, made great improvements.
The contest became still warmer. The citizens of London, profiting
by the rivalship of these excellent artists, erected organs in
their churches; and the city, the court, and even the lawyers were
divided in judgment as to the superiority. In order to decide the
matter, the famous contest took place in the Temple Church upon
their respective organs, played by eminent performers, before eminent
judges, one of whom was the too celebrated Jeffreys. Blow
&amp; Purcell played for Smith, and Lully, organist to Queen Catharine,
for Harris. In the course of the contest Harris challenged
Father Smith to make, by a given time, the additional stops of the
vox humana, the cremona or viol stop, the double courtel or bass
flute, etc., which was accepted, and each exerted his abilities to the
utmost. Jeffreys at length decided in favor of Smith, and Harris's
organ was withdrawn. Father Smith maintained his reputation
and was appointed organ-builder to Queen Anne. Harris went to
Bristol."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the first half of the eighteenth century the salaries
paid to organists were small indeed, and it was
customary for them to add to their modest stipend
in various ways. In Charleston, S. C., in 1739, the
organist taught the art of psalmody. A dozen years
before this the organist at King's Chapel, Boston,
Mass., taught dancing.</p>

<p>Mr. Drake, in his "History of Boston," says that
King's Chapel was enlarged and rebuilt in 1713, and
an organ was presented by Mr. Thomas Brattle. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
1756 the King's Chapel Society imported a new organ
from London, and the old one was sold to St. Paul's
Church, Newburyport. It was used there for eighty
years, and then sold to St. John's Church, Portsmouth,
N. H. The original pipes and wind-chest remain
to-day in perfect condition.</p>

<p>The second church organ in New England was one
in a case of English oak, presented by Bishop Berkeley
to Trinity Church, Newport, R. I., in 1733. It had
twenty-three gilded pipes and was fourteen and a
half feet high, eight feet front, and eight feet deep.
It was made by Richard Bridge, London. This organ
was used for a hundred and eleven years by Trinity
Church, till 1844, and after a sojourn of a few years
in Brooklyn, N. Y., it was bought for a church in
Portsmouth, R. I., where it still is, in excellent
condition.</p>

<p>South Carolina, with her riches and her close communication
with England, had abundant masters to
teach not only the more elementary branches, but
accomplishments as well. By 1774 there were two
hundred persons in the colony engaged in teaching,
and according to advertisements a knowledge of
English, Latin, and Greek could be obtained at any
time after 1712. French and music were constantly
taught after 1733. Lessons on the harpsichord,
spinet, violin, violoncello, guitar, and flute were all to
be had after 1733, and the boys could be perfected in fencing
and the girls in needlework before the middle
of the century. By 1734 a dancing-school was opened
at Charleston, and in 1760 Nicholas Valois gives
notice that he still receives pupils in dancing, and
that he has received "40 of the newest country dances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
jiggs, rigadoons, etc., from London, which he proposes
to teach."</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 86. HARPSICHORD.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1752 the vestry of St. Phillip's Church, Charleston,
sent to London for an organist. The parish
guaranteed him £50 sterling. He was to have the
privilege of teaching the harpsichord or spinet, which
would add 150 guineas more per annum, and also to
have "benefits of concerts which his obliging behaviour
to the gentlemen and ladies of the place may
amount to 300 or 400 guineas more." The years
between 1728 and 1763 were a time of unprecedented
prosperity in South Carolina. The luxuries of the
day were within reach of modest fortunes, and British
modes and manners were eagerly followed. Josiah
Quincy, in describing his visit to "Charles Town" in
1774, speaks of the famous St. Cecilia Society, which
began as a musical club, all the performers being
amateurs. He writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The music was good, the two bass viols and French horns were
grand. There were upwards of two hundred and fifty ladies
present and it was called no great number. In loftiness of head-dress
these ladies stoop to the daughters of the North; in richness
of dress surpass them. The gentlemen, many of them
dressed with richness and elegance&mdash;uncommon with us; many
with swords on."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Carolinians travelled often to England. They
were lively and expensive in their dress, and an
Englishman visiting Charleston in 1782 writes home
that it "was the pleasantest and politest as it is one of
the richest cities in all America." The charming old
city still retains its two first recommendations, though,
alas, the riches have flown. In 1768 the organ seen in
<a href="#Page_177">Figure 84</a>, was imported from England for St.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
Michael's Church, Charleston. Within a little frame on
one side of the organ is an inscription as follows.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Jno Snetzler fecit, Londoni, 1767.</span><br />
</p>

<p>This inscription was found on one of the pipes of the
organ when it was taken down during the bombardment
of Charleston in the Civil War. At this
time the organ was stored away in the Sunday-school
room of St. Paul's Church, Radcliffeboro, for safe
keeping. This is said to be the largest old church
organ in the country, and this church probably had
the first surpliced choir of boys. They are mentioned
in the vestry books as early as 1794. The photograph
of this organ was procured through the courtesy of
Mr. Charles N. Beesley, of Charleston.</p>

<p>In the homes in various parts of the country, besides
the virginal, were found the hand lyre, large and
small fiddle, the recorder, flute, and hautboy. Some
of these were imported, some were home-made. The
first church organ built in New England was made
for Christ Church, Boston, by Thomas Johnson, in
1752, and indeed by this time music in churches was
pretty general all over the country. The puritans,
with their hatred of anything secular, or, as it seems
now, of anything that could ornament or beautify
this none too joyous stay on earth, condemned
music. In his "History of Music in New England",
Mr. Hood says that before 1690 music was mostly
written in psalm-books, the number of tunes rarely
exceeding five or six. At the beginning of the
eighteenth century New England congregations were
rarely able to sing more than three or four tunes,
and even these were sung by the doleful process of
"lining out". The deacon would read one line of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
psalm, and the congregation would sing it. Then he
would read the next, and so on. About 1720 an
effort was made to improve this method of singing,
but it met with violent opposition. Some of the
objections advanced were that "it grieved good men
and caused them to behave disorderly;" that it was
"Quakerish and Popish"; that "the names of the
notes were blasphemous;" etc. Yet after a while
the congregations were soothed by the publication of
several "Letters of Pacification", written by ministers,
and some books were published like that of
the Rev. Thomas Walter of Roxbury, Mass., entitled:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The Grounds and Rules of Musick Explained. Or, An Introduction
to the Art of Singing by Note Fitted to the Meanest Capacity
By Thomas Walter, A.M. Recommended by Several Ministers,
'Let everything that hath truth praise the Lord.' Ps. 150.
6. Boston."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Singing-Schools for the instruction of the young were
opened, and music, the only science allowed, crept
into the church. "The Newport Mercury" for January
8, 1770, contains the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The Public are hereby informed That a Singing-School will be
opened at Mr. Bradford's Schoolhouse next Thursday evening by
a Person who has taught the various Branches of Psalmody in the
Provinces of New York, Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut and
those Gentlemen and Ladies who have an inclination to improve
in this Excellent Art may expect all that Care and Dilligence
which is necessary to their being rightly instructed in the same."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>William Tuckey of New York was a schoolmaster in
that city about 1753, and taught singing to children.
In 1766 the trustees of Trinity Church paid him £15
for performing the music for the opening of St. Paul's
Chapel in New York.</p>

<p>By 1775 choir singing had become more general,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
and the old system of lining out was dying, but dying
hard. In several parishes the singers, male and
female, were requested to sit in the gallery and
"carry on the singing in public worship." Many
anecdotes are given in Dr. Ritter's "Music in
America", showing how the choir, once called into
being, soon became a thorn in the ministers flesh,
sometimes being rebuked from the pulpit, and in
retaliation refusing to sing.</p>

<p>That the music was bad goes without saying, for
the singers were ill-trained under incompetent teachers,
and the music was often incorrect. Dr. Ritter
gives the proportion of women voices to men as
about twenty to one hundred and thirteen. The
proposition to let women sing the air was not to be
considered for a moment, since men had a "prescriptive
right to lead, and women were forbidden to take
the first part in song or any other religious service."</p>

<p>S. Howe published in 1804 the "Farmer's Evening
Entertainment", and in it gives directions for beating
time:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"To beat crotchets in common Time, let the fingers fall on the
table six inches, then bring the heel of the hand down gently, then
raising it a little higher, throw open the fingers to begin the next
bar. For triple Time, let the fingers fall on the table, then the
heel of the hand, then raise the whole hand six inches, keeping the
fingers straight, which fills the bar."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But while religious music was undergoing violent
changes, secular music was having a more peaceful
time, and instrument-builders were becoming more
numerous and successful. In 1774, in the "New
York Gazette" is this advertisement.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At Mount Vernon is still to be seen the harpsichord
bought for Nellie Custis by General Washington. In
1798, writing to a young friend at Philadelphia, she
says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I am not very industrious, but I work a little, read a little, play
on the harpsichord, and find my time fully taken up with daily
employments."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is an old song given in "Historic Landmarks
of Maryland and Virginia" as being one which Nellie
Custis used to sing, accompanying herself on the
harpsichord. We wonder who selected for her.</p>

<p>In the "Domestic Life of Thomas Jefferson" there
is a description given of Monticello, which he built
in 1770-1772, and a diagram of the lower rooms
showing where each piece of furniture stood. It
seems very sparsely fitted out, yet it had a great reputation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
for elegance. The house was but a story and
a half high, and on the ground floor was a great hall,
drawing-room, dining-room, tea-room, sitting-room,
and two bedrooms besides the one occupied by Jefferson
himself. In this latter room was a couch upon
which Jefferson rested when studying, a dressing-table
and mirror, a chair near the wall, and beside it a
small bookcase. There was no closet, so in one
corner was a rack upon which his clothes where hung.
The chief ornament to the drawing-room was his
daughter's, Mrs. Randolph's, harpsichord. Standing
about were many busts, of Alexander of Russia, Hamilton,
Voltaire, Turgot, and Napoleon, and portraits
of Washington, Adams, Franklin, Madison, etc. The
house was at least abundantly furnished with chairs,
for Jefferson himself leaves an inventory which states
that there were 36 of mahogany and 44 of gold leaf.
Of small tea and card tables there were 13. In the
dining-room, well toward its centre, stood Jefferson's
chair and a candle-stand. His particular hobby was
blooded horses, and he used only the finest Virginia
stock.</p>

<p>This same harpsichord was, as early as 1785, in
Jefferson's thoughts, and he writes to his daughter,
Polly, from France, that she shall be taught to play
on it, as well as to draw and dance, to read and talk
French, "and such other things as will make you
more worthy of the love of your friends." Even in
remote places like Monticello, where everything had
to be transported by cart, or at Johnson Hall, Sir
John Johnson's home in the Mohawk valley, harpsichords,
as well as other expensive luxuries, were to be
found. Sir John's harpsichord was confiscated by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
government in December, 1777, at the same time with
the table which is now at the Historical Rooms in
Albany. While musical instruments are only rarely
mentioned in the inventories of the great body of the
people, yet we have seen that they were here both of
domestic manufacture and imported. Thomas Harrison,
organist of Trinity Church, advertises in the
"New York Mercury" for 1761 that he has "harpsichords
and spinets imported and for sale."</p>

<p>The harp was not so often seen as other instruments,
on account both of the great cost of the instrument
and of the difficulty of tuning it. It was not until
1720 that the pedal harp was invented by a Bavarian
named Hochbrücker. By means of the pedal working
a small plate set with projecting pins, the performer
was able to raise the pitch of each string a semitone.
The mechanism was concealed in the front pillar,
and each note was affected in all its octaves. Erard
made farther improvements. The harp shown in
<a href="#Page_184">Figure 88</a> is in the Metropolitan Museum, New York.
It is a very handsome one, painted blue, and resting
on four claw feet. The pillar is fluted, and the ornaments,
three medallions of dancing girls, with wreaths
below, are executed in brass. It has forty-two strings
of gut and seven pedals. It was made by Naderman,
Paris, France, late in the eighteenth century. Naderman
perfected the action of the first pedal harp
invented by Hochbrücker. In the South Kensington
Museum, London, England, is a harp which belonged
to the ill-fated Marie Antoinette; it also was made
by Naderman in 1780.</p>

<p>The harp in its various forms is an instrument of
great antiquity. The Greeks and Romans, ever alive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
to the possibilities of everything that tended to grace
and beauty, admired this instrument not only for its
sweet sound but for its pleasing form. We must look
to Egypt for the origin of the harp, as there are representations
in their picture writings of stringed
instruments of a bow-form that support the idea that
the first conception of a harp was drawn from the tense
string of a warrior's bow. This very primitive instrument
was borne on the performer's shoulder and
played horizontally. Between this crude instrument
and the splendid vertical harps shown in the frescoes
of the time of Rameses III., painted more than three
thousand years ago, there is a chain of pictures showing
so many varieties of forms that the growth from
the bow-form into the triangular harp is explained.
The Assyrians, like the Egyptians, had harps without
a front pillar, but differing from them in using sound-holes,
and having the sound body uppermost. We
assign to King David the harp, but mediæval artists
more frequently depicted him with the psaltery, a horizontal
stringed instrument, the parent of the piano.</p>

<p>The harp has always been the instrument of the
Celtic race, and harpists were held in peculiar veneration.
For many a long year harpists traveled from
one castle to another, sure always of a welcome and
seat in a warm corner. In return they not only
amused the company with their songs, but brought
the news, and isolated and remote families often heard
from the outer world by such uncertain means as
these. For centuries the English harpers were protected
in many ways, and no one has taken advantage
of such a picturesque class with the skill of Sir Walter
Scott. The most renowned one he introduced as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
character was Blondel de Nesle, in the "Talisman,"
that wonderful picture of the days of the Crusades.
The first greeting to the youth when he appeared at
Richard's camp shows the estimation in which these
knights of the harp were held.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Blondel de Nesle!" Richard exclaimed joyfully "welcome
from Cyprus, my king of minstrels! Welcome to the King of
England, who rates not his own dignity more highly than he does
thine.... And what news, my gentle master, from the land of the
lyre? Anything fresh from the trouveurs of Provence? Anything
from the minstrels of merry Normandy? Above all, hast thou
thyself been busy?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is also said that Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion's place of
confinement in Germany on his return from the Holy
Land was discovered when Blondel sung beneath the
Tower Tenebreuse a tenson which they had jointly
composed, and to which the king replied.</p>

<p>Edward I. and his Queen were fond of music and
encouraged musicians, as the following entries in their
accounts of the household expenditures show:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"To Melioro, the harper of Sir John Mantravers, for playing on
the harp when the king was bled, twenty shillings; likewise to
Walter Luvel, the harper of Chichester, whom the King found
playing on his harp before the tomb of St. Richard at Chichester
Cathedral, six shillings and eight pence."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Henry V. was a performer on the harp at an early
age, and his wife, Catherine of Valois, shared his taste,
as an entry in the Issue Rolls reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"By the hands of William Menston was paid £8 13<i>s</i> 4<i>d</i>, for two new
harps purchased for King Henry and Queen Catherine."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These harps were tuned with a key like the more
modern instruments, and the player improvised his
words to suit the taste of the company in which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
found himself. Harpists were employed much at
courts, and in 1666 Pepys says that for want of pay to
the household&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"many of the musique are ready to starve, they being five years
behind hand for wages; nay, Evens, the famous man upon the
Harp, having not his equal in the world, did the other day die for
mere want, and was fain to be buried at the almes of the parish,
and carried to his grave in the dark at night without one linke,
but that Mr. Hingston met it by chance, and did give 12<i>d.</i> to buy
two or three links."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the present day, though at no instrument does a
graceful woman look more graceful, solo performers
are very rare; but in the orchestra the harp has an
important place on account of its tone, such composers
as Gounod, Berlioz, Liszt, and Wagner using it
freely in their scores. In this country there are only
occasional references in the old papers to it, and an
advertisement by Signor Pucci in 1815 that he gives
concerts on the "Fashionable and much admired King
David's Pedal Harp", seems to be an effort to introduce
it to the notice of music-lovers of the day.</p>

<p>Madame Malibran, who achieved such a success in
opera in New York about 1825, used to accompany
herself on the harp when she sang in response to an
encore. But it can never be considered a popular
instrument.</p>

<p>In Dwight's "History of Music in Boston", he says
that at the beginning of the nineteenth century the
population of Boston numbered about six thousand
families, and that not fifty pianos could be found.
Only a few of Boston's churches had organs, while
those in country parishes were, almost without exception,
without them. The use of instruments had crept
slowly into the choir, and if they had a flute and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
bass viol they considered they did well. Very often
a clarinet usurped the place of the flute. The bass
viol was, however, the most popular instrument, and
when, some years later, concerts began to be given,
and musical societies formed, the bass viol was lugged
about, notwithstanding its ponderous size, and duly
performed its part in the accompaniment.</p>

<p>The bass viol shown in <a href="#Page_186">Figure 89</a> is an interesting
one. It was made by Deacon Justin Hitchcock, and
used by him in the choir of the Congregational Church,
Deerfield, Mass., in 1778. Both it and the pitch-pipe
used by him as leader of the choir are now resting
silent in Memorial Hall. Deacon Justin did not confine
his musical performances to psalmody and the
accompanying of hymns. Like all the Deerfield men
of that day he was a fighter, as who should not be
who was brought up among those silent hills which
had seen so much of "ye barbarous enemy" and knew
the tales of French invasion? The stories of warfare
and captivity were still fresh in the minds of the people
of Deerfield when Deacon Justin responded to the
Lexington alarm. His fife it was that inspired the
weary Deerfield minute-men to press on to Boston to
meet the British. Nor was this the only campaign in
which he played a part, for he never wearied of displaying
the trophies captured after the disastrous
experience of Burgoyne, when, harrassed and in flight,
he abandoned his baggage.</p>

<p>A very similar bass-viol, but of German manufacture,
was played during the latter part of the eighteenth
century in a church in Stonington, Connecticut. The
sisters of the Hospital General in Montreal, before
the conquest of Canada, imported several of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
instruments from France for use in the convent choir.
So they must have been played upon by women sometimes.</p>

<p>An instrument that is interesting rather than handsome
is the glass harmonica shown in <a href="#Page_188">Figure 90</a>. It
has thirty-five bowls or glasses arranged on a central
rod. Some of the glasses are now missing, but originally
it had a compass of three octaves. The case is
three feet nine and a half inches long, and one foot
four and three quarters inches wide. The interest in
this class of instruments arises from the fact that it
was invented by Benjamin Franklin. It has about
as much capacity for producing music as the "musical
glasses". One of these latter instruments consists
of twenty-four glasses closely resembling finger-bowls
and standing in a wooden table-like case. They are
partially filled with water, and the performer produces
notes by rubbing on the rim with the finger. They
were occasionally to be met with, and date about the
first decade, possibly a little later, of the nineteenth
century. There is one in a perfect condition in
Rochester, N. Y. The case is of handsome mahogany,
and the instrument belongs to Mrs. James
McKown.</p>

<p>Up to 1760 pianos were made in the wing shape,
like the harpsichords, but at that date a man named
Zumpe made a square one. By 1800 there were a
number of makers in New York, and they turned out
many very handsome instruments. Astor, Broadwood,
and Clementi were three great makers in London, and
sent many pianos over here. There is a slender-legged,
fragile, Clementi piano in Memorial Hall, Deerfield,
which was given by a father to his daughter. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
story still clings to it that he sold a house in order to
buy it for her.</p>

<p>John Geib, and his sons, John H., Adam, and
William, were among the best-known early makers of
pianofortes. They opened a shop in Maiden Lane as
early as 1807, and advertised not only pianos of their
own manufacture, built on a new plan, but those of
London makers as well. They held this shop in
Maiden Lane, with a brief interruption of one year,
till 1828, when W. Geib moved up to the corner of
11th Street and Third Avenue. It was from this
establishment that he sold the handsome piano shown
in <a href="#Page_191">Figure 91</a>, which is now at the Historical Rooms,
Albany. The name-plate over the keyboard has the
following inscription.</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>
<p class="center">
"<span class="smcap">W. Geib, Third Avenue, Corner 11th St. New York.<br />
Manufacturer of Cabinet, Grand, Harmonic,<br />
and Square Piano Fortes, Church and<br />
Chamber Organs.</span>"
</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>

<p>This piano is mahogany inlaid, and has a handsome
brass moulding and brass ornamental bands at the
tops of the legs. It has six legs and a pedal, and
the top of the lid has a small rest for the music.
The stool, very richly carved with pillar and claw feet,
belongs to an earlier period than the piano, this shape
dating from about 1810-20.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig093.jpg" alt="Figure 93. UPRIGHT PIANO." width="600" height="502" />
<p class="caption">Figure 93. UPRIGHT PIANO.</p>
</div>

<p>Indeed, from its ornamentation, the stool would
seem to go more fittingly with the very elegant piano
shown in <a href="#Page_192">Figure 92</a>. This is of rosewood, and was
made by Robert and William Nuns, and sold by Du
Bois and Stodard, New York. It was probably made
about 1823-25, for in pattern of carving, moulding,
drawers for music, etc., it is very similar to the pianos
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
made at this time by the Geib Brothers. At the top
of each leg is a richly engraved band of brass, and
rosette, to conceal the place where the pin held the
leg to the instrument. The drawer knobs were
doubtless brass also, for these are not the original ones.
The panel above the keyboard is beautifully painted
in metallic lustre, and has two carved panels besides,
over velvet. The legs are boldly carved with the
acanthus leaf, and everything about the piano is as
elegant as possible. By the time these last two
instruments were made music had taken a decided
advance. Musical societies were organized in all the
large cities; there were the Handel and Haydn
Society; the New York Philharmonic Society; the
New York Choral Society; Beethoven Society of
Portland, Maine; Philadelphia Musical Fund; Harmonic
Society of Baltimore, and equally flourishing
musical organizations in several cities of the South,
notably New Orleans and Charleston.</p>

<p>Music-dealers all over the country advertised their
wares; there were instruction-books and sheet music to
be had:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"Overtures, battles, sonatas, duets for four hands, airs with
variations, rondos, songs, glees, catches, sacred songs, original
Scotch airs, little ballads, marches, waltzes, dances, and Mozart's
songs."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In view of the selection of good music that could
be obtained, it is amusing to know how popular were
such ditties as "Mary's Tears," "Apollo, thy Treasure,"
and "Sweet Little Ann," written by Shaw, the
blind singer of Providence. They seem hardly an
advance upon "Bid Me, When Forty Winters,"
"Little Sally's Wooden Ware," and the "Comic Irish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
song 'Boston News'" which were used as concert
selections a quarter of a century earlier.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Page_194">Figure 93</a> is shown an upright piano made by
Julius Fiot, Philadelphia, in 1827. The heavy veneered
Empire curved posts are noticeable, and an extra old-fashioned
appearance is given to it by the movable
candle-brackets fastened to either side. In the upper
part were little silk curtains to cover the mechanism,
and their arrangement does not seem to have been
particularly neat. This was a very early example of
the upright shape, and is now in Memorial Hall,
Philadelphia.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<small>CLOCKS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Contrivances</span> for the measurement of time are of
such antiquity that the first such implement is wrapped
in the mysteries of a forgotten past. Before any
mechanical form had been invented by which the rate
of motion of a staff or pointer was made to indicate the
lapse of time, the shadow of the sun in his apparent
daily progress was used to mark the passing hours.
A gnomon or pin erected so as to throw its traveling
shadow across a graduated arc constitutes a dial.
This was the earliest form.</p>

<p>The subject of sun-dials has been most exhaustively
treated by Mrs. Gatty in her "Book of Sun-Dials",
and later in our own country by Mrs. Earle. In
England and Scotland many dials may still be found
standing in old-fashioned gardens where they have
marked the flight of time for hundreds of years.
Many more dials, vertical ones, are to be found on
the walls of public buildings, sometimes on churches,
and on country houses as well. Not only stationary
dials, but portable ones also, of silver and gold, were
made and were long in use. Some of these are to be
seen in various museums over the country, but most
of them seem to have disappeared. George Washington
owned a portable dial, and had a stationary one
placed near his front door at Mt. Vernon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>In some of the famous old gardens of the South
that still survive, echoes of their former glory, the
sun-dial yet holds its accustomed place. In the very
heart of New York city there is to-day a sun-dial;
not one person in a hundred that passes knows that
it is there, nor would scarcely one person in fifty
know what it was. It stands on the lawn of Grace
Church rectory, on Broadway, near Tenth Street.
This spot of green in a wilderness of brick and stone
refreshes the eye of many a hurrying pedestrian, and
the dial marks the flight of the hours as sharply
as if it stood in a country wilderness, amid birds and
flowers.</p>

<p>The sun-dial was an important part of every great
garden in early times. One was set up at Whitehall,
England, in the sixteenth century.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In a garden joining to this palace there is a Jet d'eau, with a
sun-dial, which, while strangers looking at, a quantity of water
forced by a wheel, which the gardiner turns at a distance, through
a number of little pipes, plentifully sprinkles those that are standing
around."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>William Lawson, writing in 1618 a book on "A
New Orchard and Garden", gives the directions
about laying it out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"And in some corner (or more) a true Dyall or clock, and some
Anticke works, and especially silver sounding Musique, mixt
instruments and voyces, gracing all the rest; How will you be
rapt with delight?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1821 William Cobbett wrote his "Rural Rides".
In one of them he discourses of a visit to Moor Park,
once the seat of Sir William Temple, whose heart,
enclosed in a silver box, was said to have been buried
in 1698 beneath his sun-dial. But Cobbett casts a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
doubt upon this time-honored legend by declaring
that it was beneath a garden seat that the silver box
was buried. Charles Lamb, in his essay "The Old
Benchers of the Inner Temple", discourses lovingly
of the sun-dial. "It spoke of moderate labours, of
pleasures not protracted after sunset, of temperance,
and good hours." The dials made out of herbs and
flowers come in for a special share of his commendation.
How much more the dial induces meditation
than the clock, but how very much lost we should be,
these bustling times, if we had to depend upon one
of these delightful but irresponsible "antiques" which
say to you quite distinctly, "I mark only sunny
hours."</p>

<p>In an inventory of the property of William Bennett,
East Greenwich, Rhode Island, who died in 1753,
among other articles were mentioned "warming-pan,
pewter, sun-dial, book, debts, £10."</p>

<p>After the dial came the clepsydra, a sort of clock,
which measured time by the graduated flow of some
liquid, like water, through a small aperture. While
the hour-glass was not known in England till 886, it
had been used in Rome long before; but inventions
traveled slowly in those days. The hour-glass remained
long in use, even after the invention of clocks, and
while we know it chiefly as marking the period of
agony of some unwilling victim at the piano, it was
used even later than the noon mark on the window-ledge,
which may be seen to-day on some of the old
houses still standing.</p>

<p>A writer in the "Gentlemen's Magazine" for 1746
says that he was present on an occasion when a grave-digger
was at work in Clerkenwell Fields.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"He had dug pretty deep, and was come to a coffin which had
lain so long that it was quite rotten, and the plate so eaten with
rust that he could not read anything of the inscription. In clearing
away the old wood the grave-digger found an hour-glass close
to the left side of the skull, with sand still in it. Being a lover of
antiquity, I bought it of him, and have since learned from some
antiquarians that it was an ancient custom to put an hour-glass in
the coffin to show that the sands of life were run."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The origin of clockwork is involved in great obscurity,
though there are statements by many writers
that clocks were in use as early as the ninth century.</p>

<p>By 1288 a clock was placed in the Old Palace Yard,
London, and remained there till the reign of Queen
Elizabeth. In 1292 a clock was placed on Canterbury
Cathedral, and in 1368 a striking clock was erected at
Westminster. By 1500, clocks were used in private
houses, and watches were introduced. In 1368 three
Dutch clockmakers were invited to come to England
to teach the business to native workers, though
"Dutch clocks" and their makers were held in contempt
some years later.</p>

<p>There was a clock put into the tower of Hampton
Court Palace in 1540 by a maker whose initials were
"N. O.", all that posterity knows of him. It was the
oldest clock in England that kept fairly good time.
In 1575 George Gaver, "serjeant painter" as his title
runs, had a sum of money allowed him for "painting
the great dial at Hampton Court Palace, containing
hours of day and night, and the course of sun and
moon." In 1649 a striking part was added. By 1711
it was found that the clock had not been running as
correctly as it should, owing to the fact that some
careless or ignorant workman had removed some important
parts of the works. After this discovery it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
was left neglected for many years, and finally lost its
hands. It was in this condition in the first quarter of
the nineteenth century, when G. P. R. James wrote a
poem entitled "Old Clock Without Hands at Hampton
Court."</p>

<p>In 1835 the old works were removed, and a set of
works put in which had been made in 1690 by Villiamy,
for a clock in the Queen's Palace, St. James' Park.
As this clock was not powerful enough to drive the
astronomical works, these were put away. In 1880
this old clock was also removed, sold for old brass, and
a brand-new clock substituted. It seems a pity that
one of the earliest clocks known should have been
destroyed. It was not till 1639 that Galileo published
his discovery of the isochronous property of the pendulum,
which was eight years after the incorporation
of the London Clockmakers Company. Not only did
this company train workers for clockmaking, but they
also inspected clocks brought into England, and rejected
those which they deemed unworthy.</p>

<p>Richard Harris is said to have been the man who
first connected the pendulum with clockwork movement,
about 1641, and Harris's method was improved
by Huyghens, so that by 1658 very trustworthy time-keepers
were in use. Mr. Lockwood in his book on
"Colonial Furniture," says that the first clock mentioned
in the Massachusetts Colony was found in Boston
in 1638, but in Lechford's note-book it is said that
Joseph Stratton had of his brother in 1628 a clock and
a watch. In 1640 Henry Parks, of Hartford, left a
clock by will to the church. The first clock in New
Haven belonged to John Davenport, who died in 1670.</p>

<p>E. Needham, of Lynn, Mass., died in 1677. She left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
an estate valued at £1,117. The barn, land, out-houses
and dwelling house were valued at £400. This
included a "range of ston wall fensing." Her silver
watch, spoons, and other plate were worth £5. She had
a striking clock, another watch, and a "larum that does
not strike." These early clocks were probably like
the ones shown in <a href="#Page_202">Figure 95</a>. They were called "lantern,"
"chamber", or "birdcage" clocks. The lantern
clock shown is of the pattern known as the "dolphin
fret," on account of the ornamentation above the dial,
which is made by two dolphins with crossed tails. This
clock was made by Thomas Tompion, of London, a
famous maker, who lived in the last half of the seventeenth
century and died in 1713. He was clockmaker
to Charles II., and was held in high esteem, as may be
gathered from the fact that he was buried in Westminster
Abbey, where his tomb may still be seen.</p>

<p>Tompion was called the "Father of English Clockmaking",
and has left a more enduring fame than any
of his contemporaries. He had been a blacksmith,
and before his time watches as well as clocks had been
of rude construction, and the watch of Charles I., which
is still preserved, has a catgut string instead of a chain.
Indeed watches of that construction were in use
for a long time after the chain was invented. Very
curiously, through some of the strange chances which
govern inanimate as well as animate things, this very
watch has found at least a temporary home in this
country.</p>

</div>

<p>When Oliver Cromwell obtained his great victory
over Charles II., and drove the enemy from hedge to
hedge till they finally took refuge in the city of Worcester,
there were seven thousand prisoners and great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
spoils, among the latter the royal carriage in which
the king had been carried. In the carriage was this
watch, which was used by Charles II. as it had been by
his father Charles I. It had been made for the latter
in 1640, and after more than two centuries of vicissitudes
still ticks bravely on. It is of the earliest pattern
of watches, made entirely by hand and of great
size, as it measures four and a half inches in diameter,
and is an inch and a half thick. The case is very
handsome, of pierced silver in a pattern of flowers and
leaves, and has three winding-holes on the back,&mdash;one
for winding the works, one for the alarm, and one for
the striking attachment, which consists of a small silver
bell within the perforated case. It has but one hand
to mark the time and goes thirty-six hours. There is
an outer case into which the watch may be slipped,
made of copper with a leather cover studded with
silver.</p>

<p>The watch was kept by Cromwell himself for many
years, but after the Restoration it fell into the hands
of Joseph Kipling, of Overstone House, North Hants,
England, a relative of Rudyard Kipling. Joseph
Kipling was also an ancestor of Mr. Wilfred Powell,
British consul at the port of Philadelphia, and present
owner of the watch.</p>

<p>Robert Hooker invented the double balance in
1658, and Tompion completed it in 1675, and made a
watch which he presented to Charles II. Two others
were made and sent to the Dauphin of France, where
Huyghens had obtained a patent for spiral-spring
watches. This idea was not original with him, but
was obtained from a man named Oldenburg. It is
allowed, however, that it is Huyghens who first made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
those watches which went without strings or chains.
Barlow, in the reign of James II. is said to have discovered
the method of making striking watches, but,
Quare's being judged superior by the Privy Council,
Barlow did not get a patent.</p>

<p>Tompion's watches were in great demand for a long
time, owing to their being large and well made, the
wheels being of well-hammered brass. Three most
eminent watchmakers of this time were Tompion,
who died in 1713; Daniel Quare, who succeeded him
and died in 1725; and George Graham, who followed
Quare and died in 1775. They all belonged to the
Society of Friends.</p>

<p>Watches cannot claim the antiquity of clocks, but
they can be traced as far back as the fourteenth century.
In shape they were like an egg, and Nuremburg
claims their earliest manufacture. Although it is
said that they were introduced into England in 1577,
yet it is certain that Henry VIII. had a watch, and in
1572 the Earl of Leicester presented to Queen Elizabeth&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"one amlet or shakell of golde, all over fairly garnished with
small diamandes, and fower and one smaller pieces, fully garnished
with like diamandes and hanging thereat a round clocke fullie garnished
with diamandes and an appendant hanging thereat."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They were so unusual that they were worn ostentatiously
round the neck hanging to a chain.</p>

<p>In an old play called "A Mad World, My Masters!",
one of the characters says "Ah, by my troth,
sir, besides a jewel and a jewel's fellow, a good fair
watch that hung about my neck." When Malvolio
was telling over the agreeable ways in which he would
occupy himself after his marriage with Olivia, he says,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
"I frown the while, and perchance wind up my watch
or play with some rich jewel." Watches called "strikers"
were known in Ben Jonson's time, for he says
in his "Staple of News"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"'T strikes! One, two,<br />
Three, four, five, six. Enough, enough, dear watch.<br />
Thy pulse hath beat enough. Now stop and rest."<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Watches were in use so rarely in the early times
of James I. that it was deemed a cause of suspicion
when in 1605 one was found upon the person of
Guy Vaux. By 1638 they were more common, and
in a comedy of that year called "The Antipodes"
it is complained that&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">"&mdash;every clerk can carry</span><br />
The time of day in his pocket."<br />
</p>

<p>The prices of these first time-keepers must have
been high, but there are no records of them left. In
1643 the sum of £4 was paid to redeem a watch taken
from a nobleman in battle. In 1661 there was
advertised as lost&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"a round watch of reasonable size, showing the day of the month,
age of the moon, and tides, upon the upper plate. Thomas
Alcock fecit."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The redoubtable Pepys's curiosity extended to
watches, and he writes in his diary, December 22,
1665:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I to my Lord Brouncker's, and there spent the evening by my
desire in seeing his Lordship open to pieces and make up again his
watch, thereby being taught what I never knew before; and it is
a thing very well worth my having seen, and am mightily pleased
and satisfied with it."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The English became such famous watchmakers that
in 1698 an act was passed to compel makers to place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
their names upon those they made, in order that
discreditable ones might not be passed for English.
Among the possessions of the English Crown is a
watch which was found about 1770 in Bruce Castle,
Scotland. On the dial plate is written "Robertus B.
Rex Scotorum", and over the face is a shield of convex
horn instead of glass. Robert Bruce began his reign
in 1305 and died in 1328, long before watches were
supposed to be known in England. The case of this
watch is of silver in a raised pattern on a ground of
blue enamel.</p>

<p>Striking watches were highly esteemed. When
Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough died in 1744 she left
a will covering six skins of parchment, and she designated
the disposal of "manors, parsonages, rectories,
advowsons, messuages, lands, tenements, tithes, and
hereditaments", in half a dozen counties. She also
specified many of her jewels, and among them is her
"striking watch which formerly belonged to Lady
Sutherland."</p>

<p>The lantern style of clock before mentioned was
not original with Tompion, but had been used in
England from the beginning of the seventeenth century.
They ran by weights, and the clock had to be
affixed to a bracket or shelf in order to give room for
the weights to hang. In the clock in <a href="#Page_202">Figure 95</a> the
cords and weights have been removed. The faces of
these clocks always stood out beyond the frame, and
were of beautifully engraved or etched brass, as may
be seen in the figure. The single hand showed only
the fifths of the hour and the hours. The small dial
in the centre was to set the alarm, which struck the
bell, but in some of them the hours were struck also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>The portable or table clock came into use early in
1600, and one of them shown in <a href="#Page_202">Figure 95</a> has the
oval top to the dial which was not in use till the last
part of the seventeenth century. These were the common
house clocks of the period and were easily
carried about. Some found their way to America,
and as they were well made, with brass works, they
are still able to give correct time. This style of clock
was made for many years, and was manufactured in
substantially the same way, late in the eighteenth
century, by such famous makers as Isaac Fox and
Joseph Rose.</p>

<p>Samuel Pepys, who recorded everything that was
going on in London, in July 28th, 1660, has this entry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"To Westminster, and there met Mr. Henson, who had formerly
had the brave clock that went with bullets, (which is now taken
away from him by the King, it being his goods)."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the "Gentlemen's Magazine" for 1785 is the following
comment on this statement of Pepys.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Some clocks are still made with a small ball, or bullet on an
inclined plane, which turns every minute."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The King's clocks probably dropped bullets. Gainsborough,
the painter, had a brother who was a dissenting
minister at Henley-on-Thames and possessed a
strong genius for mechanics. He invented a clock of
very peculiar construction, which after his death was
deposited in the British Museum. It told the hour
by a little bell, and was kept in motion by a leaden
bullet which dropped, from a spiral reservoir at the
top of the clock, into a little ivory bucket. This was
so contrived as to discharge it at the bottom, and by
means of a counterweight was carried up to the top of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the clock, where it received another bullet, which was
discharged as the former. This seems to have been an
attempt at perpetual motion.</p>

<p>Catherine of Braganza was responsible for introducing
many luxuries to the English world. Pepys makes
this mention of her clock in 1664.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Mr. Pierce showed me the Queen's [the Portuguese Princess, wife
of Charles II] bed-chamber ... and her holy water at her head
as she sleeps, with a clock by her bedside, wherein a lamp burns
that tells her the time of the night at any time."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pepys speaks again in 1667 of going to see&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"a piece of clocke-worke made by an Englishman&mdash;indeed very
good, wherein all the several states of man's age to one hundred
years old, is shown very pretty and solemne."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Besides the dolphin fret shown on the Tompion
clock in <a href="#Page_202">Figure 95</a> there were other patterns, perhaps
the earliest being what is called the "heraldic fret",
which was a coat-of-arms with scroll-work on either
side. This was not used after 1650, so any clocks
bearing this pattern belong to the first half of the
seventeenth century. It was early seen that to be
accurate a clock must have some contrivance to keep
it going while it is being wound. In the old-fashioned
house clocks which were wound by merely pulling a
string, and in which one such winding served both for
the going and striking parts, this was done by using
what was called the endless chain of Huyghens, which
consists of a chain or string with ends joined together,
passing over two pulleys which are placed on the
arbors of the great wheels, and which have both spikes
and deep grooves in them to prevent the chain from
slipping off.</p>

<p>To the best clocks in England it was usual to apply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
the gridiron pendulum of Harrison or the mercurial
pendulum of Graham. The length of the pendulum
of most clocks made before 1800 was 39 inches; that
is, after the long pendulum came into use at all. The
earliest were called "bob pendulums", which swung
so far at the sides that it was often necessary to cut
slits in the sides of the case, if it was hung inside, for
it was as frequently hung outside. Many clocks which
started with bob pendulums were changed to those
having long ones, which about 1680 came very much
into fashion.</p>

<p>In Mr. Charles Britten's various books on clocks and
clockmaking he has gathered together all the minute
particulars which are obtainable on this subject, and
which are of chief interest to collectors of clocks.
Most people are content with one clock, particularly if
it be of the "grandfather" variety.</p>

<p>The term "clock" was only applied to the bell
upon which the hour was rung till well into the fourteenth
century, and as late as the time of James I.
clocks were known as horologes. Even at the present
day the old term has clung to the church-tower
time-piece in some of the least-traveled parts of England,
and in the quaint and lovely little town of
Wells the Cathedral clock is called the "horologe."</p>

<p>There are long-case clocks made by Tompion to be
found in this country; for of course all the first clocks
were of English make. The earliest long-case clocks
were made by William Clement about 1680, and within
the same year Tompion was making them too. The
peculiarities of these first clocks are quite marked and
easily distinguished, for the dials were square, and
the top of the case lifted off to permit of winding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>An early and handsome specimen of such a clock is
seen in <a href="#Page_199">Figure 94</a>. This clock was made in the latter
part of the seventeenth century by Daniel Quare, the
successor of Thomas Tompion. It is a one-year clock
and is at Hampton Court Palace. The dial face is
square, and the top lifts off. The case is very handsomely
carved and has some very handsome figures
on the top. The second clock shown in <a href="#Page_199">Figure 94</a> is
in a black and gold lacquered case, and was made by
J. Harrison in 1715. It is at the Guildhall Museum,
London. This shows the carved top of the dial face
which became universally adopted. The most important
part of one of these clocks is the pendulum, for
the long case was brought into use solely for the
pendulum, as mechanism had not been invented to
permit it to swing in a confined space. The first long-case
clocks were comparatively small in size, and
during the reign of William III., when everything
Dutch was in fashion, the cases were ornamented
with marquetry in beautiful patterns and variously
coloured woods. Sometimes this was made even
richer by inlay of mother-of-pearl, and there were cases
also of splendid lacquer-work, gold on black grounds,
like that in <a href="#Page_199">Figure 94</a>, some of which found their way
to America and are either museum specimens or
treasured in private collections. There are many
clocks with English works housed in Dutch cases, but
this is understandable from the fact that so many
Dutch cabinet-makers were settled in London.</p>

<p>Besides the square face to the dial of these early
clocks there were peculiarities of the case as well. On
either side of the upper part of the case there were
carved spiral pillars, like those we find in old chairs of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
the same period. These were occasionally finished off
by carved or gilt pilasters, and on some choice specimens,
notably of Tompion's clocks, there are pillars at
the back also. This style of pillar was used also in
Queen Anne's time. The clocks might stand flat on
the floor or be raised an inch or two on a short foot.
The long doors had mouldings, corresponding to the
period of their manufacture, and many had a piece of
glass or a bull's-eye let into the wood, so that the
motion of the pendulum could be seen.</p>

<p>Some of the most distinguishing marks on these
clocks are the hour circles. Before the minute hand
came into use the double circles seen in the mantle
clocks were in use. Between them the hour is divided
into quarters, the half hour being shown by a longer
stroke, or an ornament like a fleur-de-lys. When the
minute hand came into use, besides the double circle
containing the numerals denoting the hours, and the
smaller figures showing the minutes, there were on the
outer edge marks or divisions to denote the quarter
hours, the device being a cross or a dagger. The dial
faces were beautifully embellished with engraving,
those of the William III. and Queen Anne periods being
very rich. Not only were the faces brass, but there
were to be found silvered faces also, ornamented with
ormolu mounts of figures and scrolls in brass. All the
space on the dial was utilized; on the extreme edge a
border of leaves, or herring-bone pattern was placed,
and the whole interior of the hour-ring was engraved
or etched with flowers, scrolls, or set patterns, and even
the winding-holes had their set of circles around each.</p>

<p>Of the seventeenth-century clocks the earliest had
their makers' names put into Latin and engraved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
straight across the bottom of the dial, and quite concealed
when the wooden hood of the case was in place.
Later it was engraved on the lower half of the circle
between the figures seven and five. These two styles
were only in use very early, for about 1750 name-plates
were first used, and then makers used their own taste
in the matter, sometimes omitting the name entirely
and substituting some motto like "Tempus Fugit"
"Tempus edax rerum", and even such lengthy mottoes
as the following;</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>
<p class="center">
"Slow comes the hour; its passing speed how great;<br />
Waiting to seize it,&mdash;vigilantly wait!"<br />
</p>
<div class="topspace1"></div>

<p>Edward East was another well-known early English
maker, and some clocks in splendid cases came from
his hand by 1690 and earlier.</p>

<p>Joseph Knibb and James Clowes were other popular makers about 1700.
James Lownes made handsome clocks by 1705 and usually inserted glass in
their doors. The corners of the dials bear devices which also point to
the age of the clock. On the dials which came from the best makers till
just before the close of the seventeenth century, the ornaments were
cherubs' heads. Then the patterns of the spandrels, as these ornaments
were called, altered, and a head set in more or less elaborate
scroll-work, generally of brass, handsomely chased and often gilded,
was used. After this, in the early eighteenth century, came two Cupids
holding up a crown with a surrounding of scroll-work. The clock on the
left in <a href="#Page_213">Figure 96</a> has this fret, two cherubs holding a crown, at the
four corners of the brass face. They do not show very plainly in the
illustration, which also does not do justice to the splendid marquetry
with which the mahogany case is inlaid. Across the dial face is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
Monks, Prescot and the clock is in perfect order. The second clock is
quite as interesting. It has a fine mahogany inlaid case, the face is
painted on wood, the works are wooden also, and it is wound by pulling
up the weights by hand. The ornaments which originally decorated the
top are missing, but otherwise it is perfect and is in admirable
condition. Its period is about 1800. This clock belongs to Dr. George
W. Goler, of Rochester, N. Y., and the one previously described to Mr.
William M. Hoyt, also of Rochester.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig096.jpg" alt="Figure 96. TALL-CASE CLOCKS." width="403" height="600" />
<p class="caption">Figure 96. TALL-CASE CLOCKS.</p>
</div>

<p>A crown with crossed sceptres and foliage were also
used in the spandrels. Later in the century the passion
for rococo ornament seized the clockmakers too, and
during the reign of George III. these ornaments degenerated
very greatly, and were cast brass, often not even
touched with a graver's tool. Christopher Gould was
making clocks in 1715, and by 1745 Richard Vick's
works were put into so-called Chippendale cases. There
is such a clock now at Windsor Castle.</p>

<p>All clocks before the eighteenth century had straight
tops. An arched top was added, in which could be
placed a register for the equation of time. On some
of the latest clocks by Tompion, dated about 1709,
four years before his death, such an arch is found. It
is considered greatly to improve the appearance of the
face of the clock, and it was utilized for decoration if
not for a time register. Name-plates were put there,
and a handsome dolphin was engraved or mounted on
the dial on either side of the name-plate. A fine
specimen of such a clock made by John Carmichael,
Greenock, Scotland, and put in a mahogany case, has
been owned by a family now living in Rochester, N.Y.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
 for over one hundred and fifty years. The clock
is in good order, with the original brass works, and
has a small plate on the dial to indicate the day of
the month. The face is silvered and etched handsomely.</p>

<p>During the last half of the eighteenth century there
was a great demand for moving figures to be placed in
this arched top. Ships in motion, Father Time, etc.,
were always popular subjects, as well as painted disks
showing the moon in her various phases. The moving
figures were preferred by Dutch makers, who excelled
at this species of work. The English makers, however,
used the painted moon-disks the most. The French,
with their taste for the ornamental and elegant, never
liked the square-faced clocks. They preferred the
small clocks in ebony or alabaster casings with ormolu
mounts.</p>

<p>Julien Le Roy was a very famous French clockmaker,
whose works were mounted in florid style, sometimes
in cases of kingwood, with inlay of lighter woods,
or in ebony. Lepante made clocks dating from about
1750, and these were always in the best style and elegant
taste. Few of such clocks found their way to
America on account of their great cost.</p>

<p>By the last quarter of the eighteenth century watches
and clocks were quite common in the colonies, where
they were also made. In the "Mercury" for May 2,
1774, not only were clocks offered for sale, but</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"watches neat and plain, gold, silver, shagreen, and metal. Some
engraved and enamelled with devices new and elegant; also the
first in this country of the small new-fashioned watches the circumference
of a British shilling. John Sinnet removed to the Main St.
called the Fly, next house to the corner of Beekman's slip, the sign
of the dial against the wall."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>In this same year Basil Francis offers;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"£1 reward for any information of a man who did in a fraudulent
manner obtain one pinchbeck watch with a single case, winds up
in the face, the hole where the key goes a little flowered."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were even higher rewards offered at this time
for the return of lost watches, probably not "pinchbeck,"
for a "military gentleman offers £5 for the return
of his watch and no questions asked." The English
officers made the winter of 1778-9 very gay in New
York, quite rivaling Philadelphia, and set the fashion,
which was esteemed very polite, of wearing two
watches. The Quaker City considered this custom
ridiculous. Eli Terry, of Windsor, Conn., was one of
the first clockmakers in the United States, though
James Harrison began to manufacture at Waterbury,
Conn., as early as 1790. The first clock he made was
entered in his books, "January 1, 1791, at £3 12<i>s.</i> 8<i>d</i>".
Yet clocks were made even earlier than this, for in
1783 the Assembly of Connecticut awarded a patent
for fourteen years to Benjamin Hanks, of Litchfield,
Conn., for a self-winding clock. It was to wind itself
by the help of air.</p>

<p>In East Windsor, Conn., Daniel Burnap carried on
the manufacture of brass clocks. William Tenny was
one of the earliest makers of brass work clocks in the
United States, and worked at Nine Corners, Dutchess
Co., N. Y. Eli Terry made wooden works for his
clocks, although he had been instructed in his business
by Daniel Burnap, who used brass as well as wooden
works, and made tall-case clocks with long pendulums.
These clocks were by no means cheap, ranging from
$18 to $48, the more expensive ones having a brass dial,
a dial for seconds, the moon's phases, and a better case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>Terry's wooden-work clocks were well made and were
good time keepers, and were distributed all over New
England by peddlers. In 1807 Terry undertook to
make five hundred clocks; this overstocked the market,
and he was forced to reduce the price from $25 to $15,
and then to $10. Before 1800 the best-known clockmakers
in the United States were Daniel Burnap, Silas
Merriam, Thomas Harland, Timothy Peck, and James
Harrison, all of Connecticut. From 1806 to 1815 the
number of clockmakers largely increased, and Seth
Thomas, Silas Hoadley, Herman Clark, and Asa Hopkins
were some of the best-known men engaged in the
making.</p>

<p>In 1814 Terry invented what was called the "short-shelf
clock," in which, by a change of arrangement and
smaller weights, the pendulum being brought forward
and greatly shortened and the weights being carried
and run on each side, the whole was reduced to a more
compact form. Clock and case were sold for a moderate
sum. These clocks, like the tall-case ones, were
made with wooden wheels, but after the introduction
of rolled brass, machinery was invented by which blank
wheels could be struck out with a die, the teeth afterward
cut by machinery, and the brass-wheel clocks
made cheaper than the wooden. This was about
1837.</p>

<p>The next improvement was substituting springs for
weights. This had been done in Europe for two hundred
years, but only with the most costly parlour
clocks, and the springs were equal to the best watch-springs.
Many kinds of cheaper springs had been tried
without success, till a superior steel spring was invented
in the United States, and the springs thus produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
have for many years been sold at a price compatible
with cheap clocks.</p>

<p>The wooden pendulum covered with gold leaf, which
is one of the characteristics of a regulator clock, was
invented by Silas B. Terry, a son of Eli. America has
long taken a leading place in the making of clocks, and
that desire to have the biggest and best which is characteristic
of the youngest nation has influenced clockmaking.</p>

<p>For many years England prided herself on having
the largest clock in the world. It is on the Houses of
Parliament, London, and is known as the Westminster
clock. Its dial faces measure 22 feet 6 inches in diameter.
A larger one, however, has been erected during
the past few years in Minneapolis, Minn., by an American
clockmaker. These dial faces measure 22 feet 8
inches in diameter, and the Westminster clock has
receded to second place.</p>

<p>Among extraordinary clocks which have from time
to time been invented, none is more curious than that
made in 1767 by David Rittenhouse, of Philadelphia.
It has six dials; on the main one there are four hands
which indicate seconds, minutes, hours, and days, giving
one day more to February in leap year. Phases
of the moon are also shown. The second dial shows
the movements of planets about the sun; the third,
the moon revolving about the earth; the fourth, the
movements of Saturn; the fifth whether sun time is fast
or slow with meridian time; while the sixth gives the
combination of chimes which sound quarter hours, a
choice of any one of ten tunes being played by pressing
a knob on the dial.</p>

<p>It is not often in the United States that there is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
record of any piece of furniture staying in the same
place for twenty-five, much less one hundred years.
Yet in Westernville, Oneida Co., N. Y., there is an old
"grandfather's" clock ticking away, which with the
new year of 1903 is said to have stood in its present
position a hundred years. The home which holds this
venerable time-piece was built by General William
Floyd, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence,
and the old house has weathered the storms
as well as the clock. Built in the centre of a ten-thousand-acre
tract of land acquired from the Indians
in 1788, the lands have gradually been sold, but four
hundred acres still remain surrounding the old homestead.
The old mansion is well preserved, and there
have been no changes beyond necessary repairs. It
is of Colonial architecture, and its interior furnishings
form a feast for the lovers of the antique. There are
some rare pieces of furniture imported from England
over a century ago. The house belongs to the widow
of Admiral Sicard, and was left her by her father, the
grandson of General Floyd.</p>

<p>Of the tall-case clocks there were many to be found
all over the South, in some instances case and all
being brought from England, while in others, as was
often done, the case was made by the local cabinet-maker.
Many such clocks have, within recent years,
found their way into Newport, R. I., which is quite a
paradise for the antiquarian. The history of these
old clocks is strange. During the Civil War the
negroes appropriated many articles from the manor
houses which had been deserted, or partially sacked
or burned, and carried them to their cabins. Among
such loot were many clocks, but they were too tall to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
get into the cabin doors or to stand upright afterward.
So they were cut down, generally at the base, for the
ornamental tops, particularly if there were brass ornaments
on the top, appealed to their new owners. A
dealer from Newport heard of them, and went to
Virginia, buying all of these sawed off clocks he could
find. He took them home, had the cases restored,
and sold them all for good prices.</p>

</div>

<p>One of the most famous names in the history of
clockmaking in America is that of Willard, and to a
certain style of clock this name has been applied.
There were at least four clockmakers by this name,
Simon, Aaron, Benjamin, and Simon Jr. It is supposed
to be the latter who made the style of clock
also known as "banjo," although Mr. Lockwood considers
there is great doubt on the subject. One of
these clocks is shown in <a href="#Page_202">Figure 95</a>. They had no
striking machinery, and often varied as to the lower
part, occasionally being furnished with a brass ornament.
This one has a view of Mt. Vernon, and belonged
to the late Mr. Alfred Hosmer, of Concord, Mass.
These clocks were made during the first twenty years
of the nineteenth century. The works are of brass
and generally of excellent make.</p>

<p>In 1802 "Willard of Boston," who was, no doubt,
Benjamin, who had workshops at Roxbury and
Grafton as well as in Boston, took out a patent for
his timepieces. At this same period Terry began business
on a larger scale and by water-power. In 1814
he introduced the shelf or mantel-clock, which he
patented in 1816. Three of this style of clock are
shown in <a href="#Page_219">Figure 97</a>. All are in good condition and
are still running. They belong to Mr. William M.
Hoyt, of Rochester, N. Y.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>The central clock is a very handsome one of mahogany,
with a carved case. The ornament on the top is
an eagle, and the posts are leaves bound with a rope.
The face of Washington painted on the glass is much
better than those portraits usually are, and loses
much in the reproduction. This clock was made
by Ephraim Downs, of Bristol, Conn. The clock
on the left, made by Chauncey Ives, is also a Bristol
one, for Connecticut early obtained and has always
retained an eminence in the clock business. It has an
ornamental case with handsomely carved pineapples
on top, and a swan-necked cornice. The one on the
right, with claw feet, has a very handsome decoration
of painted patterns on a black ground. On the inner
part of the case is pasted a paper which reads as
follows:</p>

<p class="center">
"PATENT CLOCKS<br />
<span class="smcap">Patented By Eli Terry<br />
And Made and Sold by Seth Thomas</span><br />
PLYMOUTH MASS. WARRANTED IF WELL USED."<br />
</p>

<p>The faces of all three are painted on tin, the two
Bristol clocks having ornamentation of gold in the
corners. These clocks all date from 1815-20, but the
one by Seth Thomas may be a trifle earlier.</p>

<p>A more modern clock than any of the foregoing,
yet one of interest, nevertheless, is one in the commandant's
office in the Navy Yard, Brooklyn. This
old clock, which, although fifty-four years old, is not
only in good running order, but practically furnishes
the official time for the yard, occupies a prominent
position in the outer office of Rear-Admiral Barker's
suite. Its dial is about the same size as those seen in
the clocks of to-day that keep the official time, but it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
is operated by a spring instead of weights. Its
mahogany case is handsomely carved, and its brass
hands shine in a way that shows the care that it
receives. The following inscription, revealing the age
of the clock, appears on the case:</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Presented to the</span><br />
U. S. FRIGATE BRANDYWINE,<br />
<span class="smcap">by the Crew, 1849.</span><br />
</p>

<p>No one in the yard knows how the old clock got
there,&mdash;it probably drifted there, as have so many
other waifs and strays. At noon every day it is set
by official time received from the Naval Observatory
in Washington, and most of the other clocks in the
yard depend upon this reliable time-piece which has
come down from the frigate "Brandywine."</p>

<p>The collecting of clocks is a fad which few people
indulge in. Yet there are those who own ten or a
dozen timepieces, and who like to have them in running
order. The old Dutch clocks, while looking very
well, are notoriously ill-regulated time-keepers. A
collector took a prize lately acquired to an old German
clock-repairer who seemed more learned in the
ways of ancient clocks than many a more pretentious
maker. The clock did not come home when it was
promised, and the owner went to see what was the
matter. She found her old clockmaker diligently
studying a little German volume with a title which
read something like this, "Thirteen Hundred Reasons
why a Clock in Perfect Order Won't Run."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>HANDLES, FEET, STUFFS, ETC.</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the manufacture of furniture at one time or
another nearly every variety of wood has been used,
if not for the body of the frame, then for its enrichment,
and every quarter of the globe has been laid
under contribution. The island of Borneo yielded
Amboyna wood, with its beautiful mottlings and curlings,
and a very splendid cabinet was made of it for
the ill-fated Marie Antoinette by the famous cabinet-maker
of her day, Riesener. Ceylon, held by the Dutch
as a colony from the middle of the seventeenth century
until nearly the nineteenth, produced splendid
ebony which was used for whole pieces of furniture as
well as for decoration. The French term <i>ébéniste</i>, or
worker in ebony, was given to the French makers of
fine work.</p>

<p>To what abundant usage oak, walnut, and mahogany
was put we know. Rosewood, too, was another of the
choicer materials. Satin-wood, with its brilliant colour;
tulip-wood, more showy still; kingwood, dark and
rich; zebra wood, with its black and white effect, as
well as leopard and partridge woods,&mdash;were all in use
before 1800. There were, besides, cherry, yew, pear,
walnut, cedar, fir, olive, beech, sycamore, cypress,
chestnut for timber work, poplar, acacia, with limewood
and boxwood for carving.</p>

<p>For furniture which was to be painted and gilded
common deal was used. In America hickory (nut-wood,
as it was called), was very popular among the
native workers, and all the other woods were gradually
imported, except those used for inlaying, an art never
much practiced by American cabinet makers.</p>

<p>After the first leather coverings of cured bull-hide
there followed Spanish or Cordova leather, Turkey-work,
cane, rush, tapestry, brocade, woollen plush, etc.,
as styles altered from time to time and luxury
increased. In an earlier chapter mention has been
made of stuffs that were in use in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries for bed and window curtains,
draperies and upholstery. Besides all the varieties of
English goods, large importations came from East
India of such unfamiliar materials, as bejurapants
bafts, gorgorans, mulmuls, jainwars, sallampores, and
many others.</p>

<p>Miss Singleton in her "Furniture of Our Forefathers,"
gives a list of eighty different stuffs, seersuckers
being the only familiar name among them.
Presumably some of these were imported here, and
Boston merchants before 1725 advertised linceys and
flowered serges, bangalls, shalloons, Persians and fustian,
kersey, silk crêpes, cherry derry and grass.
Worsted, or hair plush, plain or striped hair-cloth,
damask, furniture dimities, moreen, harrateen and
tammy were all to be bought in the larger cities. Nor
were these goods by any means cheap. Harrateen
cost about four dollars a yard in the middle of the
eighteenth century, and a set of curtains of this same
material was valued at $210. Other goods were in
proportion; some bedsteads without beds coming as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
high as $100. But, once acquired, these household
goods were valuable assets and passed from one generation
to another, often mentioned with great particularity
by will.</p>

<p>There are various small details which are of assistance
in determining the approximate period of a piece
of furniture, and none of greater value than the handles.
The different styles of these, particularly of
brass, are quite definite. The earliest of them is the
drop handle, shown in <a href="#Page_224">Figure 99</a>, and also on the old
oak chest depicted in <a href="#Page_13">Figure 5</a>. The escutcheons
were similar, and the material of the drops on some
chests of drawers was iron, but brass was more commonly
seen, and was either hollow or solid.</p>

<p>After the drop handles followed bail handles of a
primitive type, the handles being fastened in with
wires. These handles also were of brass and were
sometimes engraved. The shape of these handles and
escutcheons is known as willow, and appears later in
a much more ornate form. See Figures 56, 57 and 59.
By this time the handles were fastened by screw and
nut. By the latter half of the eighteenth century
there were in addition to the elaborate willow brasses
(<a href="#Page_138">see Figure 64</a>), oval ones of various styles. This
shape was much affected by Hepplewhite on his sideboards,
and by Sheraton in his earlier style (see Figures
35 and 38).</p>

<p>There was a handle starting from two small plates,
either round or oval, frequently seen on swell-front
bureaus and desks of 1780 and thereabouts. One is
shown in <a href="#Page_224">Figure 99</a>. Beginning at the top of the page
the various handles in use in the eighteenth century
are shown in the order of their appearance.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig099.jpg" alt="Figure 99. HANDLES, ESCUTCHEONS, etc." width="506" height="600" />
<p class="caption">Figure 99. HANDLES, ESCUTCHEONS, etc.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>
<p>There was also a round handle with a ring lying
close within it (<a href="#Page_87">Figure 37</a>); and when the Empire
style was in favour a rosette with a ring was used on
sideboards, bureaus, writing-tables, etc. See Figures
42 and 60. The rosette with a ring was not the only
Empire style, but there were round knob handles of
brass (<a href="#Page_87">Figure 37</a>), glass (<a href="#Page_88">Figure 38</a>), and brass with
medallions of china or enamel. The glass ones, either
transparent or opalescent, were held in great esteem,
though they are extremely ugly on pieces of dark
furniture on which they were usually mounted. In
many cases they have been removed, and wooden
knobs substituted; yet if one desires an Empire piece
to look as it did when made, it will be necessary to
hunt out, if possible, a set of these knobs to put on
it. This is not so difficult a matter as might be imagined;
for even if the handles come from divers
places they will generally match, as there was small
variety in the patterns used.</p>

<p>There was a great demand for these opal glass
rosettes. Very large ones held back the window curtains,
smaller ones were used to support the mirrors,
besides those on the furniture. About this same
time (1820) those fine handles which are so eagerly
sought for to-day made their appearance. They were
china or enamel set in brass, and the patterns on the
china were often portraits of famous men like Washington,
Franklin, Clinton, and Jefferson. When
mounted on a piece of furniture like a small work-table,
which had only two drawers, the four patriots
named would make a set. There were also fancy
heads, and sometimes tiny figures, but these were not
so popular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>Brass was put to many other uses, ornamental as
well as useful, and wine-coolers of heavy mahogany
were set off with bands of it, and smaller articles, like
pipkins, were either made or bound with it. Narrow
thread-like bands of brass were used for purposes of
inlay and in the lyre-back chairs the strings were
brass, as well as the accompanying ornaments. Brass
has always been a valuable commodity in English
manufactures, and in the reign of Henry VIII. Parliament
passed an act prohibiting, under severe penalties,
the export of brass, which prohibition was not withdrawn
till as recently as 1799. In 1721 over thirty
thousand persons were employed in brass-founding in
Birmingham, England, and the business has grown
until it has become the industrial feature of that city.</p>

<p>The handles of both French and Dutch furniture
were extremely ornate, consisting of scrolls and leaves,
many of them of great beauty and delicacy, particularly
when made of water-gilt or of etched brass.</p>

<p>For the benefit of local cabinet-makers brass handles,
escutcheons, and false keyholes were imported and
on sale in America. By 1770 many cabinet-makers were
manufacturing very handsome furniture of mahogany,
cedar, or cherry, requiring handsome brasses to go
with them. A cabinet-maker of Newburyport, R. I.,
had in his shop at the time of his death in 1773 much
furniture completed and some still unfinished. He
also had several thousand feet of costly timber, sixty
brass handles valued at more than one pound, desk
brasses, fifty-four escutcheons, and old brasses, locks,
and screws as well. For bookcase and cabinet doors he
had panes of glass, most of it in sheets measuring 5 × 7
inches, which was the size commonly used in windows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
at that time. Although glass had been made in this
country for a long time we find "Bristol crown window-glass"
advertised for sale in 1771 in sizes as large
as 9 × 12 inches.</p>

<p>Besides these brasses of English manufacture, we
find another merchant advertising "three dozen
Dutch rings and escutcheons at three shillings a
dozen." Handles came at various prices, fifteen,
twelve, and eight shillings a dozen, according to pattern
and finish. The escutcheons were at proportionate
prices, eleven and eight shillings a dozen, but locks
came high, a fine-ward desk-lock bringing a guinea.</p>

<p>On much furniture, particularly that enriched with
inlay, ivory escutcheons were used, and sometimes
those of holly or other wood used in the inlay were
set in. These were in use during the last years of the
eighteenth century, and can be found in connection
with various styles of handles.</p>

<p>At the "Smith's Fly" were many metal-workers
who sold ironware and goods for cabinet-makers. At
the sign of the "Cross Daggers," Thomas Brown, as
early as 1745, had many metal furnishings on hand.
There were latches and bolts for doors and locks for
chests, drawers, and cabinets. He had polished brass
handles, locks, escutcheons, and handsome brass locks
for parlours. Ring-drops, tea-chest furniture, knobs
and knockers for street doors, curtain-rings and chafing-dishes
were advertised in 1750, and casters and
handles and escutcheons of the newest fashion were
to be found in 1751, with brass chair nails.</p>

<p>A few years later double and single spring chest-locks
could be bought, and these were sold by the
same merchant who imported&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&mdash;"choice India and Japan gilded Tea Tables, square Dressing
ditto, of which sort none were ever seen in America before."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The rate to be charged for putting on these brasses
was set down in "The Journeymen's Cabinet and
Chair-makers Philadelphia Book of Prices," 1795,
mentioned before. Common castors cost 2&frac12;<i>d</i> each,
and 1<i>d</i> extra for letting in the plate; a set of sockets
"when the legs are tapered, to fit in, per set," 1<i>s</i> 2<i>d</i>.
Iron or brass rollers were 8&frac12;<i>d</i> per pair. Fitting on a
box lock was 1<i>s</i> 4<i>d</i>, while a patent lock came extra
and cost 2<i>s</i>. Lifting handles could be put on for 1<i>s</i>
4<i>d</i> per pair. Letting in an escutcheon was 2&frac12;<i>d</i> for
each one, and letting in plates for rods in the tops of
sideboards were 8<i>d</i> for each plate. Ivory escutcheons
cost 10<i>d</i> each, and those of holly just half that.</p>

<p>If a person chose to have his furniture made on the
premises it was an easy matter, for many cabinet-makers
worked in this way, and the furniture could be
built to suit exactly the prospective owner's taste and
the place it was to occupy. None of the furniture
made in America and little that was imported here,
had the superb handles and escutcheons which were
put on French and Dutch pieces. These mounts
were executed and designed by artists, and made a
decidedly beautiful addition to the furniture.</p>

<p>Another distinctive feature of old furniture is the
foot, which in many cases points to period and
country as well as if the piece was dated. After the
turned chairs with their heavy lines and clumsy construction,
the furniture which was gradually finding
its way from Spain and Holland seemed very beautiful.
The Flemish foot, so called, turns outward, and
is found on very early chairs enriched with carving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
and having cane, rush, or turkey-work seats. This
style belongs to the last quarter of the seventeenth
century. (For illustrations see <a href="#Page_230">Figure 100</a>.)</p>

<p>Chairs of this same period also came from Spain and
Portugal, being covered with the splendid leather of
Cordova, which has now a world-wide reputation.
The woodwork of the frames was handsome enough
to correspond with the leather. These frames were
carved, and the foot turned out like the Flemish, but
it was of quite a different shape and fluted (see Figure
100).</p>

<p>This Spanish foot retained its popularity a long
time, appearing on many varieties of chairs almost as
late as 1750. It was associated with cane, rush,
leather, and stuff bottoms, was seen on arm and side
chairs with slatted backs, and backs of cane and
leather. Sometimes on the "roundabout chairs," as
those having a square seat set with one angle pointed
forward were called (<a href="#Page_128">see Figure 57</a>), only the front
foot was in Spanish style, the others being turned
knobs which accorded with the turned legs and rails.
Even on some of the so-called Queen Anne chairs
with spoon backs, a modified form of Spanish foot
was to be found, but this eventually gave way to the
familiar ball-and-claw cabriole leg, or the regular
Dutch foot (<a href="#Page_28">see Figure 11</a>). It is curious that the
cabriole leg with ball-and-claw foot was seen on pieces
of furniture like both the high and low chests of
drawers before it was used on chairs (<a href="#Page_128">see Figure 57</a>),
and the earliest of these Queen Anne chairs had the
bandy leg with the plain Dutch foot. This foot is
used with the solid splat and the spoon-shaped back
with rounded ends to the top.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>Chippendale, in his earliest work, began to use the
models then in vogue, and, with the bandy leg
which was found only on the two front legs of chairs,
used also a modified Dutch foot. Very soon he used
instead the ball-and-claw foot, with or without the
underbrace, and with the more ornamental foot the
splat became pierced and carved and very ornate and
rich. The later straight legged Chippendale chair
(see Chapter III) came into favour, with or without
underbraces, and late in the eighteenth century the
other great cabinet-makers came along, each with his
distinctive styles and characteristics. The first of
these is Hepplewhite, who never achieved the success
of Chippendale, who preceded him, nor of Sheraton,
who succeeded him, yet whose work is often very
beautiful. He did not, of course confine himself to
any one style of foot or leg, yet on many of his chairs,
tables, and sideboards he used what is called the
"spade foot." This was varied in many ways, but
the most common form is shown in <a href="#Page_230">Figure 100</a>.</p>

<p>Both Hepplewhite and Sheraton, as well as the
other makers of the eighteenth century, used a variety
of shapes of feet, for bureaus, desks, bookcases, and
other pieces which were in no way distinctive. Each
maker used the bracket foot as suited him best, adding
curves to suit his fancy or the exigencies of the
case, or inlay or even carving. A plain bracket foot
is shown in <a href="#Page_230">Figure 100</a>. The French foot (Fig. 100)
is more ornate and slender, and comes on chests of
drawers, bureaus, etc. Inlay is very often used for its
decoration, and it adds a graceful line to the piece it
is used on, which is always of choice wood inlaid or
painted.</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 100. FEET.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>The tapering fluted foot which we associate with
Sheraton is also shown in <a href="#Page_230">Figure 100</a>. Under his treatment
it was nearly always decorated, either inlaid or
carved, or sometimes both. Although we are most
familiar with Sheraton style furniture in mahogany,
he made much other furniture besides, as the following
description of drawing-room chairs shows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"These drawing-room chairs are finished in white and gold, or
the ornaments may be japanned, but the French finish them in
mahogany with gilt mouldings. The figures in the tablets above
the front rails are on French printed silk or satin, sewed onto the
stuffing with borders round them. The seat and back are of the
same kind, as is the ornamented tablet at the top of the chair.
The top rail is pannelled, a small gold bead mitred round, and the
printed silk pasted on. Chairs of this kind have an effect which
far exceeds any conception we can have of them from an uncoloured
engraving, or even a coloured one."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This does not seem like the furniture we know as
"Sheraton", yet in his books are many similar descriptions.
After Sheraton gave up manufacturing furniture,
and wrote only books of descriptions and patterns,
France had passed through the throes of the
Revolution, when the old <i>régime</i> was swept away.
Napoleon had been proclaimed First Consul, and then,
in 1802, confirmed for life, and took under his charge
even such minor details as furniture and dress. The
styles arranged to suit his whim found an echo in England.
The English Empire, both at its best and worse
estate, could boast of nothing better than a feeble
imitation of the antique, while the French Empire
was at least an expression of the conquests and successes
of one man.</p>

<p>Thomas Hope was perhaps the best exponent of
this style in England, and he industriously mingled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
emblems of the gods and goddesses, Phrygian caps
and Roman fasces, Greek amphoræ, and fabulous animals
on the furniture which he designed. In Figure
100 is shown one side of a chair designed by him, as
also an Empire pillar-and-claw leg, as rendered by
American cabinet-makers. Less ornate and ambitious,
the American treatment of this period is preferable,
for the chief use to which they put brass and bronze,
the too-abundant use of which was so characteristic
of this style, was to tip columns or pillars, and, to
some extent, the feet of tables.</p>

<p>The best old furniture which is to be found in the
United States is of this period, which was succeeded
by what may be denominated the black-walnut age,
the chief characteristic of which was abundant coarse
carving. Our cabinet-makers were very successful in
their treatment of mahogany, both solid and veneered.
The latter work has never been excelled, and shows
its perfection by the good condition in which much of
this furniture, seventy and eighty years old, is found
to-day.</p>

<p>The smaller affairs of life which go to make up the
sum of necessaries were woefully wanting in the households
of pioneers who battled with the American wilderness.
The importance of the iron pot, weighing
thirty or forty pounds, which descended by will through
three or four generations, has already been pointed
out. Pewter and brass ware were equally esteemed,
and pewter, while by no means expensive, was not so
plentiful but that many people managed with a small
supply. Pewter spoons bent and broke, and a substitute,
at least in the Connecticut Valley, was a small
clam-shell set in a cleft stick. However much pewter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
was owned, whenever the Revolutionary heroes called
for bullets, what there was was cheerfully run into
those missiles of war, and there were many "bees"
held all through the Colonies where bullets were run,
and wooden trenchers were whittled out by the young
lads to take the place of the sacrificed pewter. This
wooden ware later was smoothed down by the women
of the household with broken glass, and polished with
sand made of powdered limestone.</p>

<p>Some of these wooden articles, made of maple, poplar
or apple-wood, have descended to show with what simple
appliances our ancestors were content. How simple
were their pleasures the records of the time show. In
fact, anything so enlivening as a hanging was looked
upon as sport for a holiday. The first State's prison
was opened in 1797 at the foot of Tenth Street, New
York city. It was in use for thirty years, till the
structure at Sing Sing superseded it. Grant Thorburn,
referring to a man who was reprieved through
the efforts of the Society of Friends, writes as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"One day I went up to the park to see a man hung. After gazing
two hours at the gallows, the sheriff announced a reprieve. I
must own I was disappointed."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Though amusements and pleasures were few, even
such as came along could not well be enjoyed if the
weather were stormy, and in Washington's diary the
entry for November 29, 1789, is, "Being very snowy,
not a single person appeared at the Levee." Clothes
could not be risked; they were too valuable to be subjected
to bad weather. Romalls, amens, casserillias, and
ribdilures were high-sounding but perishable. Even
while luxury was considered, health was neglected in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
many ways, such valuable adjuncts as tooth-brushes
not being in use until about 1782.</p>

<p>Many advertisements appear in the papers of men
who combined several vocations, dentistry being one
of them, and in 1789 General Washington, after much
pain during the summer, went into the hands of John
Greenwood, dentist, of 56 William Street, New York,
who made him a set of "sea-horse teeth". This had
been a very trying summer, and one newspaper has it
that "raw rum has been found exceeding pernicious
in this extreme," and something lighter, like a "Bishop"
or "Lawn sleeves" was recommended, and study of a
book published in England called "Oxford Night-caps"
was suggested as furnishing recipes for various healthful
beverages though it was added that the rum had
better be omitted, "as it is very intoxicating, and
therefore pernicious."</p>

<p>The President's guests could choose from among
Madeira, claret, champagne, sherry, arrack, spirits,
brandy, cordials, porter, beer, and cider, yet, with it
all, unseemly intoxication seems to have been the
exception.</p>

<p>Domestic discipline in New York was enforced on
servants, whether bound or free, by means of an official
who was stationed at the calaboose on the common,
and who, for a fee of one shilling, gave a thorough
whipping.</p>

<p>Education was fostered and colleges throve. By
1760 the records state that the "King's College (Columbia)
buildings were so far completed that the officers
and students began to lodge and mess therein."</p>

<p>This was in accordance with the terms of the charter,
which further provided that the students were to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
wear caps and gowns and to be within the gates at a
certain hour. The plan of education, like our belongings,
was copied from England, and our college was,
in the most material parts, to be like Queen's College,
Oxford. The tuition fee when General Washington
entered his step-son, John Parke Custis, there,
was five pounds per annum, with room-rent four
pounds, and board at the rate of eleven shillings
weekly.</p>

<p>The late Andrew P. Peabody, writing of college life
at Harvard in 1820, says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Coal, just then coming into use, had hardly found its way into
college. The student's rooms, several of the recitation-rooms as
well were heated by open fires. Friction matches, which according
to Faraday were the most useful invention in our age, were not
yet."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He says that the feather-bed was a valuable asset (this
article had held its own for centuries), but that ten
dollars would have covered the other contents of a
student's room. It had no carpet, and a pine bedstead,
a washstand, table and desk, and three or four
chairs were all it contained, besides a cannon-ball to
be heated on extra-cold nights, and rolled down stairs
on warm ones, "at such time as might most nearly
bisect a proctor's night's sleep."</p>

<p>Our maternal great-great-grandmothers must have
had little leisure to spare from the duties that occupied
their time. Yet many of them had still-rooms where
they not only compounded the medicaments whereby
many a family was raised from infancy, but where they
made extracts and essences as well. They made, too,
from the flowers and herbs that grew in their gardens,
pomander-balls, which were used instead of vinaigrettes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the outer case being of silver or gold, and often as large
as an orange.</p>

<p>Those whose stock of trinkets did not boast one of
these metal cases used the rind of an orange, the inside
being carefully extracted, and a sponge with vinegar
and spices being inserted in its place. Rose-balls
made of leaves beaten to pulp, mixed with sweet spices,
and rolled into a ball, soon became hard, resembling
the rosaries made in the south of France. When held
in the hand they became very fragrant from its warmth.
Simpler than any of these was a rosy apple stuck full
of cloves and giving out a fragrance years after the
apple had lost all appearance or consistency of being
a fruit, and awakening in the mind an image of her
who made it in some quiet garden long ago. Like an
antique spice-ball, all this old furniture that we have
passed in review has an aroma of its own compounded
by the hand that built it, the person that owned it,
and the scenes that it has lived through.</p>

<p>Many a sober old chair could discourse of experiences
ranging from grave to gay, from lively to severe, and
every one of these antiques, whether a treasured heirloom
or a reclaimed derelict, has a charm that is not
easily excelled.</p>
